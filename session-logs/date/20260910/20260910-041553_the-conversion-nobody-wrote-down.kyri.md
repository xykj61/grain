title The conversion nobody wrote down -- a byte ceiling and a line ceiling meeting in one reader
prompt autonomous loop, lap 4516 -- take the next agent-doable lap in the mantra/tally lane
rota lap 4516, row 1 -- Air, the row that feels; law and boundary, sense touch. The threshold page asks the lap to run a hand along the fence line and press each post, and its fixed seat (single-stranded) gives the test in a verb: pull one part out and see what comes with it. That is what found this -- two ceilings that read fine apart and had never been pulled at together.
think Opened over a live cold roster pass another lap had launched at this same HEAD, so the lock was held and the runner told me to wait rather than open a second. I read while it ran.
think The air lap's question is where each thing ends. mantra/src/store.rye bounds a blob at max_blob_bytes (1 << 27) and its own head note states the principle plainly -- a ceiling read at the edge refuses before an allocation grows, where a digest refuses after. mantra/src/weave.rye bounds a weave at max_weave_lines (1 << 20) and Weave.from_v2 refuses WeaveError.TooManyLines by name. Both posts stand.
think The fence between them was a wish. read_v2_record in mantra/src/main.rye appended every row of a record read off disk and asserted the ceiling AFTERWARDS. A v2 row costs nine bytes at its shortest, so a blob standing UNDER the store's own ceiling carries 14,913,080 rows against the 1,048,576 a weave may hold -- fourteen times over, and neither module converted one unit into the other.
think Proved it on metal rather than arguing from the source: built the CLI, made a store, planted a 1,048,600-row weave record whose blob name is its honest SHA3-256, rewrote the commit record and HEAD to match. `mantra status f.txt` panicked -- reached unreachable code, exit 134 -- inside read_v2_record, after allocating every row. The named refusal from_v2 already carried never arrived.
think The sharpest part is that main.rye already knew the move. read_commit_v2, sixty lines below the reader I repaired, refuses error.TooManyFiles inside its own loop before appending. One file, two readers, the same shape of input, two different answers.
think Repair: both weave readers refuse weave.WeaveError.TooManyLines inside the loop before the row is parsed, so a record off disk allocates at most max_weave_lines rows and its text. The trailing asserts stay as postconditions that now hold by construction, with their comments rewritten to say why.
think Proving it cheaply took a shape worth recording. A record at the tree's real ceiling is 15 MB and takes minutes to read -- I measured that, a foreground run over 120 seconds without finishing -- which would price a lap-tier guard out. So the scan builds the SAME reader twice at lowered ceilings, wide at 16 and narrow at 8, and has the wide binary WRITE the stores the narrow one reads. Every blob name is then a digest Mantra computed itself, no store is forged, and no external hash tool is needed.
obs The elder reader is read at its SOURCE rather than driven, and the header says so plainly: nothing has written a mantra-weave-v1 record since 20260909, so the scan cannot make the wide binary produce one. v1_unguarded in the control moves that one reading and no other, which is the honest shape of a source claim.
obs I typed the raw `pkill -f` the baton names and it took my own shell at exit 144 -- the family's seventh firing. No peer was reached, and only because my pattern happened to be tree-local by luck. `fleet_call.sh --pattern mantra` then showed the danger in one screen: the same word matched five processes in grain-petrichor, every one refused out loud as foreign. I used --pid through the helper for the rest of the lap.
obs I worked under an inherited cold pass rather than holding still. The pass closed run_verdict=guard_red with tree_moved=yes -- the guard_red is elf_machine and the tree_moved is mine. I had the refusal's own words at my open and read them as information rather than as an instruction.
obs elf_machine is not mine and I did not touch it: sites=16 against ceiling=3, thirteen of them in tools/fixtures/s/self_matching_assert_control.sh, which landed in c496ebba9 and runs the real file(1) on purpose. It drags standing_equipment red with it, since that guard reads the recorded red state. Both read red in the inherited cold pass before I had edited anything, which is how I know neither is mine. Naming a peer's fresh instrument beats guessing at its intent.
obs The full hot roster would not close, twice: 11 guards in about 10 minutes at load average 14.5, which is Diffuser's own reading of 20260910.022809 reproduced. I stopped it and proved the round on 18 named guards instead -- the six mantra ones, standing_equipment, reds_spine_derive, reds_citation, exec_bit, mechanism_sentence, index_row_bound, session_roster_agree, log_file_claim, status_declared, rota_declared, ascii_document and living_card_ascii. Seventeen green; the one red is the elf_machine pair above.
obs I stopped my own first hot pass ten guards in, on purpose: the v2 reader's new comment said a row is refused before it is READ when the truth is before it is PARSED, and the doc comments named no refusal. Correcting a word after a pass has opened means the pass measured different bytes, so I fixed it, restaged, and opened a fresh one rather than shipping a green over a tree that had moved.
obs REDS stood 528 bytes over its bound with my row in it. Two of my folds collided with a peer's landed ones -- %676 under the same shelf name, %685 under a different one -- so I dropped mine and adopted theirs on the fast-forward, then folded %681's second incident onto the shelf its first already stood on, and trimmed my row four times to fit. The pin closes at 6 bytes of slack and a raise is still Keaton's word.
obs resin_batch.rye names max_batch_entries 16 beside max_batch_bytes 4096 and ties them nowhere. That is %678's family and mine, a third site, and I left it unmeasured rather than widening this lap.

status GREEN -- 18 named guards run hot over the staged tree, 17 green: all six mantra guards, plus standing_equipment, reds_spine_derive, reds_citation, exec_bit, mechanism_sentence, index_row_bound, session_roster_agree, log_file_claim, status_declared, rota_declared, ascii_document, living_card_ascii. The one red is elf_machine and the standing_equipment self-red it causes, both red before my first edit and both named on the card as a peer's. tame_style_check and width-check GREEN; reds_ledger_monotone verdict=ok; both living pins under bound. The full roster did not close at load 14.5 and I say so rather than claiming it.
recommend keep-going -- resin_batch.rye's entries-against-bytes pair is the same family at a third site, and asking it is one bounded lap in this lane
