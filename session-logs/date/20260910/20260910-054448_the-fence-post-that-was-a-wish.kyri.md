title A ceiling declared four lines above the struct it was drawn for, and read by nothing
prompt the standing fleet baton -- take the next agent-doable lap in the mantra and tally lane
rota lap 4526, row 1 -- Air, the row that feels; read the threshold page and took its fixed test literally -- check a boundary by pressing on it, and if the hand passes through, the boundary was a wish
think My lane's three open reds -- %689, %680, %678 -- each stand OPEN on a door wanting Keaton's word, so they surfaced as gates rather than work. %519's local half is already repaired and its fleet half has an instrument, tools/fixtures/p/plant.sh, at 27 of 242 controls adopted with a floor of 13.
think Air's fixed seat says a boundary is tested by pressing on it. So rather than reading declarations I asked, for every pub const max_* my lane declares, what the file actually DOES with it -- and the first probe was wrong in a way worth recording: gawk reads \b in a regex as a backspace, so every constant read as unread. Spelled the boundary in POSIX character classes.
think 31 declared ceilings in mantra and tally. Twenty-two refused by name, four sized an array, one clamped with @min, one was derived by a second constant -- and two were held by assert alone while one was read by nothing at all, anywhere in the tree.
think The unread one is the sharp case. mantra/recall_subscribe_poll.rye declares max_mirror_pairs = 4 four lines above the PeerBoltPair struct it was plainly drawn for, and poll_one_cycle walks pairs.len with no ceiling; poll_cycles then casts that length to u32. A loop with no named max wearing a declared ceiling that reads as though the bound were kept.
think tally/gardens.rye is the same fault milder: add has declared itself !void since 20260620 and returns no error at all, so every try at a call site is dead syntax, and max_name_len, max_gardens and the no-duplicate rule stand on asserts. Its invariant comment claims the name is copied into a fixed buffer of max_name_len; NamedRegion.name is a slice and no field ever made a copy.
think Fourth firing in four days -- %678, %688, %689 each stood a declaration further forward than its enforcement -- so the loom was owed. It gates only unread, which is decidable with no judgment, and ratchets asserted_only, because a repair lands there and a wall would refuse the fix in the same breath as the fault. The sibling ceiling_pair measured four lexical discriminators for its own class and every one leaked, which is why this reaches for the narrow gate.
obs The load-bearing control leg is 8: plant the unread ceiling, watch it bite, give the same constant a named refusal in the same pen, and watch it leave the population. A guard that kept refusing after the repair would punish the fix.
obs add_division taught an ordering property I had not looked for: divide moves the parent's cursor, so a refusal after it spends the parent's bytes on a garden the collection never holds. Both callers weigh the admission first now, and main reads the parent's remaining bytes back after a refused division.
obs The pin had no room and both attempts to make some collided. I folded %687, and the rebase found a peer had folded the same row in the same hour; I folded %690, and a peer had folded that one too, onto the very filename I had chosen. So the row was born on its own shelf as %696 -- the move %693 made three hours earlier, since a BOOKED row that may fold may also be born there.
obs The tree-wide figure -- 532 declared names, 2 read by nothing -- is FREE outside my lane, held by no gate. Run the scan rather than reading the number.

file tools/fixtures/c/ceiling_teeth_scan.sh -- six classes per declared ceiling, one gate at zero and one ratchet that only falls
file tools/fixtures/c/ceiling_teeth_control.sh -- thirteen behaviors on real Rye in a real git pen, every refusal planted and lifted
file tools/c/ceiling_teeth_witness.rish -- the guard, asserting the census, the ratchet ceiling, and every control leg by name
file tally/gardens.rye -- GardensError and one admits weighed before any mutation; four refusals proven from the failing side
file mantra/recall_subscribe_poll.rye -- both poll functions refuse error.Overflow past max_mirror_pairs, ahead of the walk and the intCast
file tools/t/tally_gardens_witness.rish -- pins the four refusal names and both admits calls; its spoken line swept to ASCII on touch
file construction/standing-equipment.kyri -- rosters ceiling_teeth at tier lap
file construction/archive/REDS-a-ceiling-read-by-nothing-rows-696.md -- the row of 20260910.054213, born on its own shelf because the pin stood six bytes under its bound
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- the account, the Git nib, and the elder block shelved whole
scope one class found by pressing rather than reading, two instances repaired on metal, one loom seated over the lane; the tree-wide half reported and left to its lanes
status GREEN -- ceiling_teeth_witness exit 0 with control_fail=0, tally_gardens_witness GREEN, tame_style_check and width-check GREEN, both modules built and their selftests held; cold pass 229 guards with one red, elf_machine, which is a peer's pen plants and which their own commit ed76bad18 repaired upstream; the hot close after the rebase reads 232 guards, tree_moved=no, no reds
recommend keep-going -- the loom is seated over one lane and the other lanes adopt by naming themselves in its roster row, which is a mechanical lap per lane
