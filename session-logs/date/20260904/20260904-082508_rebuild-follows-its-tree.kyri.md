title rebuild-outer follows its own tree -- Dallas has no ~/grain
prompt Keaton pasted cd /home/keeper/grain on Host pier; bash said no such file or directory, and rebuild-outer.sh was missing at that path.
think Dallas holds grain-incense, grain-pheromone, grain-petrichor. The Mac field is ~/grain. rebuild-outer.sh hardcoded /home/keeper/grain/nixos, so even a pull in a ship tree would still aim at a missing path. Fleet-loop already cds to the tree that contains the script. The rebuild script now does the same: REPO is dirname of $0.
think Skip copy when /etc/nixos/configuration.nix is absent or a broken symlink to the old ~/grain path. Switch this checkout's flake anyway.
obs Pull and run from grain-petrichor (Dallas). Do not dirty grain-incense with flake.lock if that seat will loop. First switch still compiles rustc 1.97.1.

recommend check-in (Cursor) -- ls grain-* then pull grain-petrichor and bash nixos/rebuild-outer.sh
