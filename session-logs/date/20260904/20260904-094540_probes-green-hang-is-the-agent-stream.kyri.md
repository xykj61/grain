title Probes green -- hang is the agent stream, not DNS or auth
prompt Keaton pasted ps empty, both auth.json 893 bytes Sep 3 19:10, curl HTTP/2 200 on agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh and api2.cursor.sh.
think Auth is on host and in the jail map, same mtime. HEAD to both hosts returned in fifteen seconds. DNS, TLS, and a short HTTP/2 request are fine. The hang is cursor-agent's long-lived agent stream, the same Connection lost / NGHTTP2 family Cursor's forum tracks. Next door is the documented pong smoke with timeout, not another LOOP_LAPS. HTTP/1 fallback is ~/.cursor/cli-config.json useHttp1ForAgent if pong also drops. Jail maps ~/.cursor onto loops/cursor, so a jail lap needs the twin there.
obs Do not LOOP_LAPS from this GUI sitting. One writer. Paste pong plus --version.

recommend check-in (Cursor) -- pong smoke with timeout; then LOOP_LAPS only if it returns
