title the boundary stayed at capacity
prompt recover parked grass work before new work and close every lap whole
think proved the newest parked packet reachable on both remotes, then honored the live filesystem boundary before launching another roster
obs stash zero's packet is reachable at commit 32641e4d3 on xy/main and debrided/main; the stash remains preserved
obs the root filesystem reports 679 MiB available and 100 percent used on 20260914 at 03:27 EDT
obs log_has_a_row scan and direct control are green; its first wrapper run ended before the control completed, while index_row_bound is green
loom filesystem_available=679MiB filesystem_use=100pct
loom remotes_ahead=0 remotes_behind=0
rota lap 4821, row 1 -- Air, the row that feels; a proof run needs enough bounded storage to finish and leave a trustworthy transcript
recommend check-in filesystem capacity remains the blocking red before another full roster pass
scope read the handoff, inspect parked work and the newest transcript, verify both remotes, and recheck the live capacity boundary
status RED -- parked work and focused log checks are sound; a full cold or hot roster cannot finish reliably while the root filesystem remains full
