title Guide 1 movement 1-2 -- keeper wheel sudo, prove second terminal, do not close root yet
prompt Run the rebuild and create keeper with sudo permissions.
think Write configuration.nix with keeper, Mac jail and dc1 keys, wheelNeedsPassword. Leave PermitRootLogin prohibit-password. Rebuild flake /etc/nixos#pier as root. passwd keeper. Prove ssh -l keeper and sudo -v from a second Mac terminal. Closing root is movement 3 after that proof.
obs Keep the root SSH session alive until keeper is proven. First rebuild creates flake.lock and fetches nixpkgs.
