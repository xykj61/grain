title Zig 0.16 on Linux needs -lc for getpid -- one-off bootstrap, musl if no FHS libc
prompt Stuck on first-hour step 3 rye bootstrap, libc must be explicitly specified, getpid in build_lock_acquire.
think Toolchain GREEN. bootstrap.sh zig build-exe has no -lc. Zig 0.16 errors on extern c without it. NixOS has no FHS libc so -lc may then miss crt1. One-off with -lc first; if linker fails, -target x86_64-linux-musl -lc uses Zig's bundled musl. Do not re-auth. Do not edit the field bootstrap unless a later lap. Stay in rye/ until bin/rye version, then back to root for rishi.
obs SEA rye binary was not cloned. Leave SEA up.
file rye/bootstrap.sh missing -lc on the zig line
recommend check-in (Cursor) -- paste rye version or the next linker error
