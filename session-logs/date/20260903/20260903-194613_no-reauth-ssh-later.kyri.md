title Keep the PAT -- SSH deploy key is a later mint inside the clone, not a second gh login
prompt Should I re-auth adding a new ssh key?
think HTTPS PAT already clones and can push. Re-running gh auth login is needless and easy to set protocol back to SSH. Deploy key is generate_jail_local_keys_linux from a host shell once the clone and rishi exist, then gh ssh-key add, never a second token paste. Harvest jail will need that key; host tmux does not tonight.
obs Leave SEA up until Harvest pongs from its clone.
file tools/g/generate_jail_local_keys_linux.rish the later mint
recommend check-in (Cursor) -- clone Harvest over HTTPS if not already, pong, SEA still up
