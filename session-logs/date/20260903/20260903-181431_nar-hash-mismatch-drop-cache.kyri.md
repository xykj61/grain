title nixos-install status 102 -- lock file changed the path hash, drop cache, retry
prompt Steps 4-6: nixos-install created flake.lock then NAR hash mismatch, status=102.
think Guide movement 7 named this: flake directory identity includes the lock. Cache still held the pre-lock NAR hash. Disk is mounted. rm -rf /root/.cache/nix then the same nixos-install. Reboot still gated on status=0.
obs Do not treat 102 as an install. SEA stays up. Stay in tmux.
file nixos-guide/20260803-164117_0-standing-a-declared-pier.md rm cache after lock
recommend check-in (Cursor) -- paste echo status after the retry
