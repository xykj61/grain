title send diverged on a peer commit, rebased, pushed clean
prompt continuation of the same turn; no new task named
think the first git push xy main refused with "fetch first" -- a peer (copal) pushed
  ba3ac334db (claim the nona-season-n2 chapter witness roster) to xy/main while this
  lap was writing its own log.
think a plain git merge --ff-only xy/main then refused as diverging, since the local
  commit and the peer commit share the same parent (bfd70b1802) rather than one
  following the other.
think git rebase xy/main replayed the local session-log commit onto the peer's new
  tip; the rebase's own post-commit hook printed two advisory debts (regenerate
  readme_metrics and geode_libraries, weigh the touched pin) which this commit's
  content does not trigger -- a session-log-only commit touches neither.
obs twice-pulled, never forced: no force-push, no amend of the peer's commit, no
  stashing of real work -- a clean rebase and a second push resolved the divergence.

recommend kg -- send landed at cc90af9c36; language lane stays empty, waiting on Incense.
