title Incense declines a twenty-fourth lap; a paragraph-splitter disagreed with its own prior reading
prompt Autonomous overnight loop, incense-inner.md rite: round-open, claim-check, read the ledger and the card, decide whether law-lane work has reopened.
think Round-opened with fleet_round_open.sh -- already on the anointed order, open on ffa0b188c4, the prior lap's own commit. No new upstream commit.
think Ran fleet_claim_scan.sh --check against construction/REDS.md and construction/ITINERARY.md. Board carries bakery-root-finder-convert (stale, 14h) and copal-ironbeetle-ep036-census-roster (building, fresh), neither in this lane. verdict=clear.
think Read construction/ITINERARY.md's agent-doable queue directly: %642 (scrub trade) and %519 (spread adoption, sourcing=44/remainder=353) stand exactly as every prior lap this week found them, each naming a human word rather than a lap.
think Re-verified the REDS OPEN roll. First tried a crude grep -A3 per row number, which produced garbage (730/729/456 blank, wrong boundaries) -- exactly the trap prior laps warned about. Wrote a Python re-split keyed on the next **REDS %N** or **REDS (`stamp`)** header as the row boundary; it answered 765 as BOOKED and 808/735/730/729/456 as NONE (no verdict found in its own slice).
think Rather than trust either automated reader, read each of the six disputed rows (765, 808, 735, 730, 729, 456) by direct grep context and read the row's own closing sentence by eye. All six close **OPEN** -- the splitter's boundary regex was catching nested bold markers or a sibling row's header inside its own slice and throwing off the tail match, not a real ledger change.
obs This is the same lesson four prior laps already booked under this same decline streak: a script's paragraph-boundary heuristic is not the ledger. The ledger's own prose, read directly, is the only reliable oracle for an OPEN/BOOKED verdict here -- and it is cheap enough (six greps) to always prefer over a clever regex.
obs No law-lane work reopened. %642 and %519 are unchanged word-for-word; all sixteen REDS OPEN rows are unchanged; the claim board holds nothing in this lane. This is a correctly idle lane rather than a stalled one -- the fleet is moving in bakery and copal.
rota lap 24, row 4 -- Water tastes. Did not open the full council grid this lap; the decline itself was the whole reading, and the taste here was in re-verifying the ledger's own words rather than trusting a derived reading of them.
file recursion-prompts/incense-inner.md -- appended the twenty-fourth decline account to the next section, in the same shape as the prior twenty-three, naming the splitter disagreement and its resolution by direct read.
recommend keep-going -- the rite is honest and cheap; hold this lane until a human glances at %642, %519, or any of the sixteen OPEN REDS rows, or until a future lap finds the ledger has actually moved.
scope incense's own lane (law, active-designing, iterative review); no other seat's work touched.
status GREEN -- round-opened clean, claim board read and clear, ledger re-verified unchanged by direct text after a derived reader produced four false negatives and one false positive; inner-prompt next section updated in this commit.
