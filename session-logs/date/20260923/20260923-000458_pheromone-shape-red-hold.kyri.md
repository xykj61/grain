title Glow shape lap held by roster red
prompt read the pheromone baton and continue the current autonomous lap
think Recovered the parked seat state, checked the upstream claim board, and opened a claim for the bounded Glow shape-15 ruling.
think Pushed the claim/card commit at cf47170a4, read HEAD once, and held the tree while the full cold roster ran to completion.
obs The cold receipt closed with tree_moved=no, 366 guards, 317 green, 46 red, and 3 gated; Glow-specific guards were green, while the roster-wide red prevented a new product build.

rota lap 6253, row 3 -- Water, the row that tastes; its close-reading rule surfaced that the actual second run and the actual seam matter more than a stamped claim, so the unbuilt shape claim was closed after the roster red.
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri claim opened before build, then closed when the lap stopped
file construction/ITINERARY.md claim nib carried on open and close
file session-output/standing-equipment-cold.txt full cold receipt; run_verdict=guard_red
recommend check-in Cursor -- roster reds remain open; rerun from a settled head before reopening the Glow shape build
scope claim coordination and full cold roster; no Glow product files changed
status HOLD -- cold roster guard_red with tree_moved=no; claim closed, no product work landed
