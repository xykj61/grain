title The app the platform launches -- a real iOS application with a Rye delegate, both doors proven
prompt Keaton's kg on the next movement; the crux picked the iOS shell rung.
think UIApplicationMain takes its delegate BY NAME, which fits a runtime-registered class perfectly: GrainRyeDelegateIOS registers over NSObject with two Rye methods before the call, and the platform finds it, instantiates it, and drives launch into Rye -- application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: answering true, then the run loop proving itself by delivering a scheduled close on the platform's own timer, then a clean self-exit a probe may take and an app never would, said so in the header.
think The bundle is the iOS shape -- flat, plist and executable side by side -- packed by a Rishi witness that builds what it runs and proves the install door from both sides: the plist-stripped copy refuses, the whole bundle installs, and simctl launch --console carries the three delegate lines out of the platform's own launch.
obs Three small teachings for the recipe's page: this std fork carries no argv surface and UIApplicationMain accepts the honest empty pair since the kernel's args reach NSProcessInfo regardless; Rishi passes no backslash escapes into a shell string, and a space-free SDK path needs no quotes anyway; and the probe's prints ride stderr, so a witness reads launched.err rather than launched.out.
obs Movement three's iOS twin stands beside its macOS original: menu-and-bundle there, bundle-and-launch here, the delegate steering both, the refusing leg biting at both install doors. The second pass now holds four rungs -- cross-build, spawn, the view seam, the app shell -- and the touch rung is the one door left before the iOS twin story closes whole.
