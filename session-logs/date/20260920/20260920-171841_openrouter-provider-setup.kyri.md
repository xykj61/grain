title OpenRouter setup instructions researched, chat-printed, and written into open/PROVIDER_SETUP.md
prompt the operator asked for chat-printed CLI setup instructions for OpenRouter or a recommended alternative cloud open-weight-model provider on this pier, then for the same content adapted into the open/ room in the tree's own Gauge/Bhakta/Radiant/Twilight/Civic/TAME voice
think loaded WebSearch and WebFetch rather than writing from training-data memory alone, per docs-implementation-sync.md's assert-it-dont-assume-it, since API base URLs, key-page locations, and model slug formats are exactly the kind of fact that drifts
think fetched OpenRouter's own quickstart page directly rather than trusting only the search snippet, confirming the base URL (https://openrouter.ai/api/v1), the Authorization Bearer header shape, the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable convention, and the author/slug model-identifier format
think searched for exact GLM/Qwen/DeepSeek/Kimi slugs and found the page summarizer could not reliably extract literal slug strings from OpenRouter's discovery page -- rather than guessing a slug and risking a fabricated identifier landing in a written guide, wrote the lookup command instead (curl the /models endpoint and grep) so a reader always resolves the CURRENT slug rather than trusting one typed into a document that will age
think searched for the llm CLI's OpenRouter plugin to give a named, maintained CLI path beside the dependency-free curl path, and confirmed the exact install/key/invoke sequence (pip install llm, llm install llm-openrouter, llm keys set openrouter, llm -m openrouter/<slug> "...") from the plugin's own README rather than inventing plausible-looking commands
think searched three alternative inference providers (Together AI, Groq, Fireworks AI) to answer the recommendation honestly rather than naming OpenRouter alone -- found each rewards a genuinely different thing (Together: catalog breadth and price at scale; Groq: raw speed and cheapest-per-token on its own curated list; Fireworks: developer experience for agents and structured output), which is exactly the Civic-style question this tree's own context/CIVIC_STYLE.md asks first: what does the thing actually reward
think chat-printed the instructions first, in the shape the operator asked for, before writing anything to a file -- confirming the content stood on its own as a readable answer rather than only working once formatted into the room's own document shape
think wrote open/PROVIDER_SETUP.md blending four of this tree's registers in one document rather than splitting into four files the way the room's earlier round did: Bhakta for Part 1 (what a router is, assuming no background), Gauge Field for Parts 2-3 (concrete numbered steps), Civic register for Part 4 (a comparison table naming what each provider's pricing model rewards, per context/CIVIC_STYLE.md's own First Principle), and a TAME lens closing Part 5 (verify before trusting, and an explicit statement that nothing here is wired into the tree yet)
think ran the register scan against the new file and the whole tree after writing it, per the discipline this same room's earlier round taught the hard way -- explain_listed=8 sentences flagged individually, whole-file and whole-tree verdict both read ok, so no rewrite pass was needed this time
think added the new file's row to open/README.md's own table, matching the room's established front-door pattern rather than leaving the new page unlisted
obs kept every model-slug and API-shape claim traceable to a fetched source rather than to memory, and where a claim could not be verified precisely (the exact current slug strings for GLM/Qwen/DeepSeek/Kimi), wrote the lookup command instead of a guessed string -- the same choice docs-implementation-sync.md asks for when a fact is uncertain: name how to check, rather than assert an unchecked answer
obs marked the whole page Status Vision, consistent with every other page in this room, since no tracked code in this tree calls OpenRouter or any router today
file open/PROVIDER_SETUP.md -- new: the setup guide, five parts across four registers
file open/README.md -- edited: one new table row
recommend check in (either) -- confirm whether OpenRouter is the provider worth actually wiring into a future fleet-loop integration, or whether one of the three named alternatives (Together AI, Groq, Fireworks AI) should be the first one built against instead; this page names the choice rather than making it
