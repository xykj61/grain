title three rooms, and the parity that is a tombstone
prompt Keaton said kg tally, mantra, comlink -- the three rooms still under twenty percent.
obs A ninth false positive turned up first: comlink/virtio_net.rye declares its own fn assert(ok: bool) for a freestanding target with no std behind it, and the pattern read the declaration as a call. Six such declarations stand in the tree.
think My first fix skipped any line beginning a function declaration, and the control failed nine ways -- its planted one-line functions carry the assert on the fn line. Narrowed to a declaration NAMED assert. The control caught it, which is what it is for.
obs mantra's weave asserts line.gen % 2 == 1 in six places, and the reason is that the PARITY IS THE TOMBSTONE -- an odd generation means present, so an even one reaching there is a deleted line being treated as live. Nothing had said that, and it is the whole data model in one clause.
obs mantra/src/main.rye asserts a line carries no tab and no newline. Those are the field and record separators of its own serialization, so one inside a line would split it into two on the way back. A round trip that silently gains a line is the fault that assert prevents.
obs comlink/virtio_net.rye reads as a transport contract once written: found, version, device id, FEATURES_OK, then the queue. Each is a step the specification fixes in order, and skipping one leaves a queue set up against a device that never agreed to it.
obs tally/gardens.rye holds the sharpest bound -- the divisions together never claim more than the parent holds. A child past the parent's buffer would allocate over its sibling, which is the whole promise a division makes.
obs comlink's peer table asserts a slot is live before a get and free before an upsert. A freed slot still holds the bytes of whoever had it last, so reading one would hand back a peer that left.
obs All three rooms read 100%. Tree 97%, gap 468, and no room sits under 92%.

file tools/fixtures/invariant_coverage_scan.sh a fn declaration named assert is not a call
file tools/fixtures/invariant_coverage_control.sh two legs for it, and the narrowing the first draft needed
file tally/gardens.rye 19 blocks -- the region cursor and the division bound
file mantra/src/weave.rye the parity tombstone said out loud
file comlink/virtio_net.rye the transport handshake read as an ordered contract
recommend keep-going what is left is one thin tail -- caravan 217 at 97.6%, image 57, lotus 47 -- and 456 of the 468 already carry an unlabelled reason, so most of it is seating a label rather than finding a why
