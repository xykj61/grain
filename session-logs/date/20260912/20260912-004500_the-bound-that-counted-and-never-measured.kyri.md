title the bound that counted and never measured
prompt the standing baton -- PATCHOULI, lane mantra/ and tally/, lap 4671
rota lap 4671, row 1 -- Air, the row that feels; read the threshold page, TAME_CORE and single-stranded, then ran the row's own instruction against my own lane. The threshold says a claim of a boundary is tested by pressing on it and a hand that passes through found a wish, so I went looking for the fence around max_weave_lines and found a fence around one of the two things that number governs
think reds first -- %680 and %689 are both mantra seams wanting Keaton's word, one on document-versus-merge ordering and one on a record widening, so neither is agent-closable. Nothing else of mine stood open
think the seat prompt says the merge of two weaves and the annotation are the next real work; both landed already, with their own rostered witnesses, so the charter line is stale and the lane needed a reading rather than a build
think the air reading then took the module's own bound literally. max_weave_lines is 1 << 20 and it bounds a COUNT of lines. A position and a run are each a u32 carried in a record read off disk, and I could find no reading of their VALUE anywhere in the module
think so a v1 record of one row at 4,294,967,295 passes the length check, passes the rising check, passes the generation check, and reaches next_pos = row.pos + 1. Proven in a pen rather than argued: exit 134 at weave.rye:592
think the same fault stands one function over and arrives through a different door. A v2 record whose header counters sit at the ceiling restores clean, because from_v2 only asks whether each row stands below its header, and the first insert then meets self.next_pos += 1 -- exit 134 at weave.rye:1063
think the ceiling on the value is derivable rather than invented, which is what makes the repair a statement of something already true. A position rises once per line in apply, a run once per inserting edit, and merge takes the MAXIMUM of two counters rather than their sum -- so a weave standing inside the line bound is inside the counter bound by construction
obs one case the line bound cannot see, and it is why the two checks stand apart rather than folded together. from_v1 accepts positions that RISE without being dense, so a record of two rows at 0 and max_weave_lines - 1 lifts to a weave holding two lines whose counter has spent to the ceiling. The count reads two against a bound of a million and passes; the counter is the reading that refuses
obs apply's guard is written as a subtraction rather than a sum on purpose. Both counters stand at or under the ceiling by the weave's own invariant, so the difference is a real number where the sum is exactly what overflows -- and two entry asserts now state the invariant the subtraction rests on
obs the welcome is asserted as hard as the refusals. A counter standing exactly AT max_weave_lines is lawful, since it is the number a full weave's counter reads, so the v2 witness proves it passes -- a bound proven only in the refusing direction cannot be told from a bound that refuses everything
obs three mutations planted and each bit, all exit 134: from_v1's check to if (false), apply's position guard to if (false), from_v2's position-counter check to if (false). The first two return the original panic, which is the bite naming itself
obs honest limit named in the paper and the row. The CLI's own disk path was already guarded -- store.rye recomputes each blob's SHA3-256 on read and refuses a name that disagrees -- so a hand-edited blob under .mantra never reaches these functions. What this repair reaches is the module's published edge and the door a peer's weave arrives through, which is the door merge exists to open
obs my cold pass was reaped mid-run at 72 of 267 guards with 0 red, its process gone with no run_verdict line. Nothing in the transcript names a cause
obs the row is born on its shelf as eleven before it were: reds_pin_capacity_scan reads pin_deadlocked=1, rows_that_fit=0, pin_foldable_rows=0, so no fold is lawful and the pin cannot take a row. its number was read from the anointed spine after a fetch, and renumbered to %724 on the next lap's rebase when a peer published %723 against an earlier stamp

file mantra/src/weave.rye one named CounterPastCeiling and three edge checks -- from_v1 before the counter rises off a position, from_v2 on both header counters read apart, apply on the insert run and the edit run; two entry asserts and a widened bound doc
file mantra/src/weave_v1_lift_witness.rye prove_counter_ceiling_refused -- the u32 ceiling row, and the sparse lift asserted at both halves: it stands, and the insert on it refuses by name
file mantra/src/weave_v2_witness.rye prove_counter_ceiling_refused -- both header counters refused apart, and a counter standing exactly at the ceiling welcomed

file construction/ITINERARY.md the account and the git nib, trimmed to the 40960 bound
scope one keystone -- the weave's two counters get the ceiling the line count already had, derived from the module's own construction and proven from both sides
status CUT MID-SEND -- the work stood whole and proven, the hot pass never ran, and no commit was made. The round-open stashed it fifteen minutes later; the next lap recovered it from stash@{0} and landed it, and this line is written by that lap rather than by this one, which could not write it
recommend keep-going -- merge and annotate reach these counters through @max alone and name no ceiling of their own, which is the next reading in this lane
