title bite() asserts its mutation landed, REDS %828 booked and folded
prompt continue the incense inner-loop rite: round-open, claim, cold run, log
think round-opened clean at 1acfbf8cd0; claim board read five rows all past expiry, verdict=clear, no new instrument or booked red taken this lap so no claim opened
think fleet_call.sh confirmed no cold run already in flight before launching a fresh one
think read HEAD once (1acfbf8cd0), launched standing_equipment_run.sh --detach --cadence-slice 1, held fully still across six Monitor re-arms (~55 minutes)
think transcript closed run_verdict=guard_red, 371 green, 8 red, 3 gated, tree_moved=no; all eight reds matched the standing/untriaged set exactly; gates unchanged
think commit_parent_claim (REDS %828, flaky) ran green this run
think rather than close a clean confirming lap, took up %828's own named scoped work: bite() in commit_parent_claim_control.sh copied the scan and applied sed_inplace without ever checking the edit landed, so a non-matching sed pattern would silently grade an unmutated file
think hardened bite() to assert sed_inplace's exit code and a cmp diff against the untouched scan before grading, printing mutation_landed=no on either failure; hardened the direct m_anchor leg the same way, since it duplicated bite()'s logic inline rather than calling it
think proved both directions: real patterns all read mutation_landed=yes (checks 43 to 49, 0 failures); a planted non-matching pattern (s/NOPATTERNMATCHESTHIS//) read mutation_letter_clause_landed=no, control_verdict=red, exit 1 -- caught rather than silently graded
think ran commit_parent_claim_witness.rish GREEN, tame_style_check GREEN, ascii_document_scan verdict=ok
think booked the repair into REDS %828, moved its status marker OPEN to BOOKED, folded it with reds_fold.sh to a fresh shelf, recital line written, reds_fold_witness.rish GREEN (62 legs), ledger monotone and shelf-resolve witnesses both verdict=ok
think found recursion-prompts/incense-inner.md itself already 2,078 bytes over its own 24,576-byte bound before this lap wrote anything -- one consolidation pointer plus six lap accounts (20,889 bytes) folded to a fresh archive shelf, leaving one pointer in their place, per the-writer-sheds
think N mod 5 on commit count 6821 lands row 1, Air -- feels; its own teaching (every rule keeps a line drawn somewhere; a bounded thing is trusted because its edge is clean) is what this lap practiced twice, giving bite() a clean edge and giving the card back its own
obs a clean confirming cold run became a scoped repair lap rather than a no-op, because the row's own OPEN text already named exactly what was missing and the control was already proven flaky rather than broken -- nothing to reproduce, only a defensive assertion to add and prove
obs the card shed was found opportunistically while touching the file for its own next-section update, not as a separate discovery
file tools/fixtures/c/commit_parent_claim_control.sh -- bite() and the m_anchor leg now assert their mutation landed before grading
file construction/REDS.md -- %828 accreted a Repaired paragraph and moved OPEN to BOOKED
file construction/archive/REDS/REDS-a-mutation-that-never-landed-rows-828.md -- new shelf holding the folded %828 row
file construction/archive/REDS/REDS-fold-recital.md -- new trail line for the %828 fold
file recursion-prompts/incense-inner.md -- next section folded to archive 54, this lap's own account appended
file recursion-prompts/date/20260930/20260930-074032_incense-next-log-archive-54.md -- new shelf holding the consolidation pointer plus six lap accounts
recommend kg -- fresh round-open next lap, check for an in-flight pass before launching a second cold run, hold still with --cadence-slice 1 until run_verdict lands, confirm mutation_*_landed stays green on the next cold run touching this control
rota lap 6821, row 1 -- Air, feels; the row that reads boundary law, practiced here by giving bite() a clean pass/fail edge and by folding the card back under its own byte bound
scope one inner-loop lap: round-open, claim check, cold endurance run held to close, a scoped repair to REDS %828's named gap proven on metal both directions, the row booked and folded, the card shed under its own bound, session log
status GREEN -- cold run closed guard_red with zero new reds against the standing set; commit_parent_claim_control.sh hardened and proven both directions; REDS %828 booked and folded; ledger and fold witnesses all green; card back under its byte bound; both remotes pushed
