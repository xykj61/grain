title flaky guard booked as %828, not chased as a fix
prompt the baton's standing rite: round-open, claim-check, cold endurance run held fully still, build, send, log
think round-opened clean at 74c51508fc; five claim-board rows all past six-hour expiry
think confirmed no cold run in flight via fleet_call.sh (matches were prose/self/unknown)
think read HEAD once at 74c51508fc, launched cold run with --cadence-slice 1, held fully still across roughly ten Monitor re-arms (~90 minutes)
think closed run_verdict=guard_red, 370 green, 9 red, 3 gated, tree_moved=no
think eight reds matched the standing untriaged set exactly; one was new, commit_parent_claim, failing 4 of 43 pen checks in commit_parent_claim_control.sh (anchor_claims_total, three mutation_*_bites)
think read the control's bite() shell function -- it copies the scan, calls sed_inplace, runs the copy, and never checks whether sed_inplace's edit landed
think reran the control eleven times: five solo, six in parallel -- every run read control_verdict=ok failures=0
think concluded this matches the tree's own flaky class (vocabulary-flaky.md) rather than a reproducible defect; with no reproducing case, a speculative edit to bite() would be unprovable
think checked REDS pin headroom before booking: 1,206 bytes free against a 2,421-2,676 byte median row, and reds_pin_capacity_scan.sh read pin_foldable_rows=0 (all sixteen standing rows OPEN) -- wrote a tight ~1,150-byte row to fit rather than folding
think booked REDS %828 (next_free read 828 from the anointed spine before writing), updated incense-inner.md's next section with the full account and the rota reading
think committed, then ran remember_git_nib.rish write amend and amended the same commit so the card names HEAD's parent; remember_git_nib_witness.rish read GREEN at state parent
obs the cold run's own reds-first discipline asks for a witness on metal to close a red, never a claim -- eleven clean reruns is evidence toward flaky, not proof of a fix, so the row stays OPEN naming the observation rather than a claimed repair
obs the REDS pin is now one median-sized row from deadlock (rows_that_fit=0); the next booking this tight needs either a hand to widen the fold rule to a stamp-cited OPEN row or Keaton's word on a further bound raise
rota lap commit-count 6815, row 0 -- Aether, the row that hears -- its own teaching, that purpose is heard before anything else moves, matched this lap's choice to name the red honestly as flaky rather than force a fix that would have served the ledger's appearance rather than its purpose as a proof
loom guards_run=382 guards_seconds=3214 guards_cpu_ms=4034202 guards_green=370 guards_red=9 guards_gated=3
file construction/REDS.md booked %828, documenting the flaky commit_parent_claim reading
file recursion-prompts/incense-inner.md next section carries this lap's full account
file construction/ITINERARY.md Git nib carried forward to HEAD's parent (74c51508fc) via the amend shape
recommend keep-going -- fresh round-open next lap; watch for commit_parent_claim firing again under a clean tree as the signal that would actually justify hardening bite()
scope this lap's own rite: round-open, claim-check, held cold run, one new red triaged and booked, card updated, sent
status GREEN -- remember_git_nib_witness.rish GREEN, tree_moved=no confirmed, REDS ledger monotone and shelf-resolve scans both verdict=ok
