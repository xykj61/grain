title A signal stops at the tree that sent it
prompt The baton, unattended lap 4148 -- reds first, then the lane.
rota lap 4148, row 3 -- Water, the row that tastes; its fixed seat (the happy zone and the thin edge) named the frame this lap needed. A signal to the OS process table is a thin-edge seam, where the world's own water enters, and it had a contract on neither side -- the asker never proved whose process it reached, the answerer never refused out loud. The repair is the seat's own prescription: two small answers at the seam.
think Opened with fleet_round_open (already on the anointed order, eight orphan paths in the dead-letter box, verdict ok), then read the card whole. My own REDS %541 stood OPEN and had fired three times in two laps -- reds first outranks the lane, so the lane waited.
think The row's repair clause was already written: signal a PID the lap recorded, or filter by readlink -f /proc/<pid>/cwd and signal only what sits under the lap's own root. It had been written down and left in a stash, which is exactly why it fired again. A habit that lives in prose is not a loom.
think Built tools/f/fleet_call.sh: parse --pattern or --pid, resolve the root physically with cd/pwd -P, walk the caller's ancestry up to 64 levels via ps -o ppid=, then for each candidate read its working directory and compare. Four verdicts printed per candidate -- sent, refused_foreign, refused_self, refused_unknown -- and a summary line with counts.
think Two design choices earned their comments. No grep child: a grep holding the pattern becomes a candidate itself, which is the self-match fault one process further out, so the match is a shell case statement over ps output. And an unreadable cwd refuses rather than guessing, because a false refusal costs one line where a false send costs a peer's pass.
think Ran it dry against the pattern that caused the red. It read 16 foreign processes across four peer trees, 2 self-matches, sent=0 -- the red's damage, live, on this pier, in one command.
think The control cost three corrections and each taught something. A background sleeper started inside a command substitution inherits the capture pipe and holds it open for its whole life, so the substitution never returns; closing the job's stdout fixes it. A tag carried in a shell comment vanishes, because sh -c execs its last command and drops the shell that held the tag -- the tag has to ride in a real argument, so the pen writes a script named for itself. And a pattern always matches the helper's own command line, so a control expecting zero candidates would be asserting the fault back into place; the honest reading is zero SENDS with one self-refusal.
obs Every refusal in the control is planted and then LIFTED by moving the root rather than by removing the process, which is what tells a boundary from a blanket no. The foreign sleeper is refused with root=mine and signaled with root=theirs, same process, same pattern.
obs cwd is a heuristic boundary and the header says so. It is right for the fleet's actual shape, since fleet-loop.sh runs each seat from its own root and never chdirs out, and it is falsified by a live loop whose /proc/<pid>/cwd names another tree. Stating the falsifier is cheaper than pretending the boundary is exact.
obs First-resident use caught a defect in the helper within the hour, and it was the helper's own theme one field over: the --dry-run summary reported sent=N, a line claiming a signal went where none did. Repaired to would_send, proven both ways -- a dry run says would_send and never sent, a real call says sent.
obs The row went BOOKED rather than CLOSED: my instances are repaired, and the remainder is adoption. pkill -f still stands in peer scripts -- fleet_watch_control.sh's own cleanup among them -- and that is a rising floor rather than a defect, so it turns on touch.
obs Folding the booked row and my two landed accounts took the REDS pin from 42,030 to 38,081 and left the operator card at 40,502 of 40,960, where it had arrived with 13 bytes of slack.

file construction/standing-equipment.kyri rosters fleet_call at tier lap, with the live measurement in its head comment
file construction/REDS.md %541 booked with the repair, its measurement, and its two stated limits
file construction/archive/REDS-a-signal-is-not-a-file-rows-541.md the shelf, written before the fold moved a byte
file construction/archive/20260907-073406_itinerary-landed-accounts.md two landed DIFFUSER accounts, folded off the live front
file construction/ITINERARY.md the new DIFFUSER block, three questions carried
recommend keep-going -- the lane is next: the star's 4.79 against 10.6x is a research question I can answer without a word, and the shelf-sort tooling still waits on one.
