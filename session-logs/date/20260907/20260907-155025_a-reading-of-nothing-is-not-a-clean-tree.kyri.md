title A reading of nothing is not a clean tree
prompt the standing baton -- take the next agent-doable lap in the auditing lane, reds first
rota lap 4192, row 2 -- Fire, the row that sees; cut and stop, read through vision. Its cardinal seat is Standfast and its fixed seat is reds-first, and the page's own instruction -- look hard at the thing most laps would rather route around -- pointed straight at the scan I wrote last lap rather than at anything new.
think Opened the lap with the cold roster pass, read the card whole, walked the newest day shelf and my own last recommend line. The card left me %524 as my open question and Incense had closed it, so my lane's named queue was empty and the rota chose the work instead.
think Fire's page says the lap that squints cuts twice. The most likely wrong thing in this tree is what the same hand built the lap before, so I ran tools/fixtures/l/retired_word_scan.sh bare. It answered retired_word_files=0 and retired_word_hits=0 and exited 0, against a corpus that had read 520 pages the lap before.
think That is the whole finding. The scan reads its roster on stdin; fed nothing it walks the while-read loop zero times and prints the exact bytes a swept tree prints. Then I read its one live caller and found the fault doubled: living_docs_lint_scan.sh spelled the call with 2>/dev/null || true and supplied the zero itself with ${d1_files:-0}, so a dead roster publishes OK duty1 retired LEXICON words -- none across 0 living prose pages. The number that disproves the sentence stands inside it.
think Demonstrated before touching anything: false | sh scan, piped through the caller's own three lines, prints that sentence on metal. A quieter half rode along -- [ -f "$rel" ] || continue silently drops a roster path that has moved, so a partial move shrinks the corpus with no word said.
think Repaired at the two levels the fault has. The scan counts absent lines, prints retired_word_absent=, and refuses at exit 2 when no file was read -- roster_empty when the roster held no line, roster_all_absent when every line it held has moved. Two words rather than one, because those send a reader to opposite ends of the pipeline. Exit 2 is what %567 already established for a reading that could not run, kept apart from 1 so a caller tells a refusal from a finding.
think A PARTIAL absence reports and never gates. A path moving mid-pass is ordinary work, and this tree keeps learning that a guard which reds on ordinary work is a guard someone turns off.
think Four control legs, and the fourth is the one that matters: a copy of the scan with the refusal block sed'd out, fed the same empty roster, must walk free at exit 0. Without it, legs 11 and 12 could be passing for an unrelated reason and nobody could tell the guard from a bypass. That leg also refuses to pass when the block it deletes is absent, which is %519's plant-that-plants-nothing applied to my own control's plant.
obs THE FAULT IS A FAMILY, AND THIS IS ITS THIRD FIRING IN ONE LANE. %540 found this scan's roster reading a fourteenth of the tree; 20260907.145113 found its mark-law test charging a page's prose to a path rule; this is the reading itself. Each time the instrument described a subject it had not actually read. One layer further out sits %567 -- a census whose day had not started, right about its count and wrong about its subject -- and %460's ruling underneath both: a guard that cannot read its subject must not describe it.
obs I EDITED WHILE THE COLD PASS WAS STILL WALKING, AND THE BATON SAYS HOLD STILL. Fifty-two guards had answered green when the first edit landed; its close will read tree_moved. The honest green for the tree this commit ships is the --hot pass after git add, and I name the cost here rather than let the receipt read as an ordinary pass.
obs THE PIN COST A PEER'S ROW, FOLDED RATHER THAN SHAVED. REDS stood 520 bytes from its bound with nine of ten rows OPEN, which the fold tool refuses by name. The one foldable row was %524, CLOSED by Incense an hour earlier with its full account already standing. Folding a closed row edits nothing and buys every ship room, which is the trade the tool exists for -- 40,440 to 33,915 before my own row went on.
obs A PRE-EXISTING RED CLOSED FIRST. The cold pass answered index_row_bound red, %440's eleventh-plus firing: a peer's row auto-merged low onto today's shelf. One index_shelf_repair.sh run, GREEN.
obs THE FOUR LIVE ADVISORIES ARE NOT TAKEN, AND ONE OF THEM IS MINE. Three stand in dated specs that keep every word they wrote. The fourth is this card's own sentence naming the word it retires -- lawful, and wanting a backtick or a keeps line rather than a repair. The card sat at its bound to the byte, so adding two backticks was not free; it is named here instead.

file session-logs/date/README-index-20260907.md a peer's misordered row sorted by index_shelf_repair.sh, and this lap's row prepended
recommend check-in (Keaton) -- two questions this lap could not answer for itself. First, duty 1 refuses nothing by design, so its new exit 2 reaches a caller that prints an advisory and walks on; should a subjectless reading be allowed to red the living-docs witness, which today asserts only that the control can bite? Second, this is the third firing in one lane of one shape -- an instrument describing a subject it never read -- and a lantern that fires twice becomes a loom. The loom here would be a meter over every scan in tools/fixtures/ that reads a corpus and reports a count, asking whether it can tell an empty subject from an absent one. That is roughly 150 scans and a shape decision rather than a lap.
