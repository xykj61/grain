title The watch that skipped the bench
prompt Keaton: it has been minutes and I am not seeing window 1 looping; and, update the docs itinerary for grass or other to update docs-geode with these operating manual instructions, and maybe unify manual/ and docs-geode.
rota none -- a repair and a booking asked mid-round; the Aether row was read this round at 20260907.053708.
think I told Keaton to exit and let the watch arm incense. He exited, nothing happened, and he came back. The claim was mine and wrong, so the first job was to find out why rather than to guess a workaround.
think The watch's own transcript said it in one word on every start line: skip 'incense'. WATCH_SKIP defaults to the captain's bench, by design, because that window normally holds a hand.
obs I RECOMMENDED A MECHANISM WITHOUT READING ITS DEFAULT. I checked that the watch matches windows by NAME and that incense is a live seat, and both were true; I never checked whether the watch was willing to arm that seat at all. Two correct facts and one unread line, and the advice was confident. The transcript had been printing the answer on every start since the watch was first launched.
obs THEN THE FIX ITSELF FAILED SILENTLY, WHICH IS THE SHARPER FINDING. Passing WATCH_SKIP= still printed skip 'incense', because ${WATCH_SKIP:-incense} treats an EMPTY value as unset and restores the default. A hand asking for no skips got the default and no message saying so -- the fallback-reads-as-an-answer shape this tree books reds for, one room over from the || true I removed hours ago. Changed to ${WATCH_SKIP-incense}: unset still means the default, empty now means what it says.
obs PROVEN BY THE WATCH'S OWN VOICE RATHER THAN BY THE FILE. After the relaunch it prints: incense -- loop absent yet the pane is not at a prompt; not typing into it. That is the seat SEEN and correctly refused because I am sitting in it, which is exactly the behaviour wanted, and it could not be told from the elder silence by reading the script.
obs THE BOOKING WENT TO PETRICHOR RATHER THAN GRASS, AND THE ROSTER SAYS WHY IN ITS OWN WORDS. docs-geode is petrichor's lane -- tend, never rename -- and grass's lane note warns against this exact mix-up in a comment written after somebody made it once. Keaton named grass or other; the roster is the other.
obs THE CARD HAD 147 BYTES OF HEADROOM, SO NO REAL BOOKING FITTED. A card entry POINTS; the brief argues. The full booking went to active-development and the card carries two lines, and one elder booking was condensed to its own pointer under a cairn -- 41,784 down to 40,921 against a 40,960 ceiling.
obs THREE BOOKINGS ARRIVED AND THE CARD HAD 147 BYTES OF HEADROOM. A card entry POINTS; the brief argues -- so all three went to active-development pages and the card carries one line each. Even then it took folding a landed booking (vendor+seed laps C-H, whose laps landed 20260906) and condensing two more to their own pointers to fit, landing at exactly 40,960 of 40,960.
obs I DREW A CAIRN FOR A FOLD I THEN DECLINED TO MAKE, AND CORRECTED IT RATHER THAN LETTING IT STAND. The first cairn said the Open doors block would fold; reading it showed three LIVE questions awaiting Keaton's word, and hiding those to save bytes is the one thing a card must not do. The cairn was rewritten to name what actually moved. A walk-back marker that describes a different act than the one taken is worse than none.
obs AND THE REAL ANSWER IS STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN ANOTHER SHAVE. INNER LOOP is 30,916 bytes of the card's 40,960 -- 75% -- so every future booking will fight for the remaining quarter. Three grants in one night each cost a fold; the fourth will have nothing left to fold. That fold is a round, not a 3am trim, and it is named here so the next hand meets it rather than rediscovering it byte by byte.
obs THE LANES WERE READ RATHER THAN GUESSED. Keaton said grass or other for docs; the roster says docs-geode is PETRICHOR's, tend never rename, and grass's own lane note warns against that exact mix-up. Mantra and the weave are PATCHOULI's, which is why petrichor's molt grant is conditional on confirming synergy rather than free to touch them. Whitepaper research is DIFFUSER's, in tandem with bakery, and the store's implementing lane -- copal or bakery -- is part of the deliverable rather than assumed.
