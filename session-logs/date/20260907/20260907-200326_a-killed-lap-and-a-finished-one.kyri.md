title A killed lap and a finished one
prompt Keaton: the lap did say it completed for incense; I cancelled the loop right at completion; not sure if that is a red. Then: approve.
rota none -- this lap answered a question about the record itself, and landed a peer lap that had been interrupted; the Aether row was read by the lap it recovered.
think Keaton asked whether it was a red, so the first job was to find out rather than to reassure. A lap claiming a send it never made would be a red; a lap interrupted before its send would not.
think I grepped the cancelled lap's log for any push, nib, or landed claim: one hit, and it was an unrelated sentence about an elder move. The lap claimed nothing false. So the cancellation was not the fault.
obs THE INCIDENT WAS CLEAN AND IT STILL EXPOSED SOMETHING. Nothing in the record said the lap had been interrupted. A lap killed mid-send and a lap that finished and declined to send read IDENTICALLY from the log -- two different facts, wanting two different repairs, wearing one appearance. Only Keaton's own word told me which had happened.
obs THE FIELD THAT WOULD SAY SO IS ABSENT FROM FOUR LAPS IN FIVE. session-log-provenance asks every log to finish with scope and status. Measured across this day's shelf: 95 logs, 21 carrying both, 73 carrying NEITHER, 1 with scope alone. The law states it and the fleet mostly does not follow it -- the same shape as the rota field two days ago, and invisible for the same reason: nothing counted it.
obs REPORTED, NEVER GATED, AND THE INCIDENT IS THE ARGUMENT RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE. A lap killed mid-send cannot write a status by definition. A gate would therefore red hardest on exactly the laps that were interrupted -- punishing the accident it exists to make visible. That is the clearest case for a counter over a wall I have met.
obs THE BATON CARRIES THE WHY, NOT JUST THE INSTRUCTION. It now says write status BEFORE the send rather than after, because after is precisely when a cancelled lap cannot. A rule that says what to do and not when is a rule an interrupted lap breaks without noticing.
obs I GAVE THE CANCELLED LAP THE STATUS IT COULD NOT WRITE, AND SAID SO IN THE FIELD ITSELF. Its status line names the guards I ran to verify its work, records that the work stood staged when the loop was cancelled, and names that a later hand added the line. A field filled in by someone else is honest only if it says so.
obs THE ROSTER TAUGHT ME SOMETHING WHILE I WAS SEATING THE GUARD. My first insert failed because a peer had added `capability day_shelf` to the sibling guard -- the day-shelf scans refuse when the open day has no shelf yet, which is honest rather than a fault. The new guard carries it for the same reason, learned from the failure rather than from a doc.
obs THE CANCELLED LAP LEFT ONE MORE MARK, AND IT IS THE SHAPE THAT KEEPS RECURRING. The shelf it wrote kept the link depth of the page it was folded out of -- six links across three spellings, an archive/ prefix, a ../.claude/ and a bare ../ -- so the guard reddened on work I had just sent. A fold moves a file one level down and every climbing link must gain a level; this is the fourth time this week the same fault has arrived from a different hand.

scope one question answered by reading rather than reassuring, one interrupted lap landed, and the gap it exposed made countable
status GREEN -- status_declared 11 of 11 and rostered, fleet_roster green, tracked links ok, the recovered lap sent at f62038a05
recommend keep-going -- the same reading fits `loom`: a lap that measured nothing and a lap that forgot to record what it measured are one appearance, and the field already exists.
