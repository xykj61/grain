title The field reaches the ships
prompt Keaton: kg, and keep printing path recommendations at the end.
rota lap 4119, row 4 -- Earth, the row that breathes in. Its question is the concrete one: what already stands true before anyone argues with it. The concrete fact today was that a law was seated last lap and no ship had been told.
think Last lap seated the rota field in the session-logs law and measured the day at 24 declared, 59 prose-only, 43 silent. A law in a rule file governs a ship only if the ship reads that file, and what every ship reads on every lap is the baton.
think So the lap is the shortest possible distance between a seated law and the hands that must follow it: the ROTA stanza now says record it in a field, gives the exact shape, and carries the three numbers so a reader meets evidence rather than an instruction.
think And the census needed one more answer than it had. Three buckets described what happened; none of them let a lap SAY that it honestly did no rota read. `rota none -- <why>` counts as declared now, which turns a guess into a record.
obs THE LAW WAS SEATED AND THE SHIPS WERE NEVER TOLD, WHICH IS THE WHOLE GAP EARTH IS FOR. A rule seated in .claude/rules governs a lap that reads it; a lap reads the baton. Between those two facts sat a law nobody would follow, and the row whose question is what already stands true is exactly the lens that finds that.
obs A THREE-WAY SORT WITH NO WAY TO DECLARE ABSENCE FORCES A LAP TO LOOK NEGLIGENT FOR BEING HONEST. A pure-repair lap that did no rota read had only silence available, which reads identically to skipping. Giving it `rota none` costs one line and converts the largest bucket from unknowable to answerable.
obs THE SCAN REFUSED TODAY AND THE REFUSAL WAS CORRECT. The day turned at midnight; session-logs/date/20260907 did not exist, so the census refused rather than reporting three zeros -- REDS %170's law working on the first lap of a new day. This log is what opens the shelf.
obs THE FIRST LAP OF A NEW DAY OWES THE PIN A ROW, AND TWO GUARDS SAID SO. The census refused because session-logs/date/20260907 did not exist; once this log opened it, log_has_a_row refused because the pin still named 20260906 as the open day and knew no shelf for the new one. Both refusals were correct, and together they are the whole shape of a day turning.
obs MY PIN ROW READ "closed" AND THE PARSER READ NOTHING. I wrote `| `20260906` closed | 126 |` where every other row is `| `20260905` | 61 |`, so the awk that keys on the first cell found no day and reported no_pin_row for a row plainly on the page. And 126 was recalled rather than counted: the shelf holds 131. Two faults in one line, both from writing what I meant instead of what the format is -- measurement beats memory reaches formats too.

file tools/f/fleet_baton.txt the ROTA stanza names the field, its shape, its three numbers, and the honest-absence form
file tools/fixtures/r/rota_declared_scan.sh `rota none` counts as declared, with the reason written beside it
file tools/fixtures/r/rota_declared_control.sh two cases for the honest absence -- declared, and not counted silent
file .claude/rules/session-logs.md the absence form seated, naming the baton as how it reaches every ship
scope one Earth lap -- the distance between a seated law and the hands that follow it, closed
status GREEN -- rota_declared 11 of 11, fleet_roster green; the day census refuses honestly until this shelf exists
recommend keep-going -- tools/f/fleet_baton.txt now carries the field, so tomorrow's reading of tools/fixtures/r/rota_declared_scan.sh is the falsifier: if silent does not fall, the baton is not where ships take their instruction.
