title the fence the neighbour had
prompt the standing fleet baton -- take the next agent-doable lap in the mantra and tally lane
rota lap 4171, row 1 -- Air, the row that feels; the threshold says test a claimed boundary by pressing on it and single-stranded says pull the part out, so I pulled mantra/src/diff.rye out from under mantra/src/weave.rye and the hand went through
think Opened with the round-open state read rather than assumed -- tree clean, eleven stashes standing, cold roster running through its 139 guards while I read.
think The card names four Patchouli questions and three are Keaton's word (the interleave seam, %530's double binding, gating a transcript). The fourth, rota_declared's midnight red, is already answered by the day_shelf capability seated 20260907.003211, which asks the guard's own question in both halves. So the constructive lane was open.
think Read the air row through its own sense. weave.rye names max_weave_lines at 1 << 20 and reads it at the edge of both apply and merge before a line is appended -- an exemplary fence. Pressed the module one seam over, the one whose output apply consumes.
think mantra/src/diff.rye allocates an LCS table of (m + 1) * (n + 1) u32 cells in a single allocator.alloc call, from two lengths the caller chooses, and carried no named max, no named error, and no edge check. Its two usize -> u32 seam casts therefore ran with the bound that makes them safe unstated, which is the one thing TAME's width law asks of a seam cast.
think Two 100,000-line documents would have asked for 40 GB in one call, and the request would have been made rather than refused.
obs The sharpest reading is inside the guard rather than the module: tools/m/mantra_diff_witness.rish announces its lens on line three as "one named max, an invariant on every function, bounds read at the edge", and no leg of that guard read its own opening line. A stated lens is not a checked one.
obs Repaired derived rather than restated, because a quantity spelled in two files is a quantity two files will one day disagree about. max_diff_lines IS weave.max_weave_lines imported; max_diff_table_bytes is stated in bytes at one gibibyte, since bytes are what the machine has; max_diff_table_cells is derived from it by sizeOf(u32).
obs Two named refusals rather than one, because two sides that are each inside the per-side ceiling can still ask for a table that is not: TooManyLines and TableTooLarge.
obs check_bounds is a function rather than two inline ifs on purpose -- so the boundary can be pressed by hand. Proving the per-side ceiling by BUILDING a million-line document costs a million slice headers to learn one boolean, and proving the table ceiling that way costs a gibibyte. The function costs nothing, and diff calls the same function at its own edge, so the decision proven and the decision applied are one decision.
obs Three new claims, each shown from both directions. The ceiling admitted at side where (side + 1) squared IS max_diff_table_cells, refused by name at side + 1. The derivation asserted against weave.max_weave_lines itself. And diff handed a side one line past the ceiling, refusing at its own edge before the table -- 16 MiB of slice headers, not a gibibyte, because the refusal arrives before the allocation.
obs Claim 10 exists for the phase claim 8 cannot see. edge_check_removed leaves check_bounds standing and correct and deletes only the call, so the decision is right and nobody asks it. A bound nobody calls is a bound.
obs Not taken and named: the table stays quadratic. A ceiling names what an algorithm costs; an index is what would change it, and that earns its place when a measurement asks rather than before.
obs My own slip, named rather than left in the transcript: the COLD pass was redirected to a constant /tmp name, which is exactly the habit REDS %549 booked OPEN this morning -- eight ships share this pier and therefore one TMPDIR. The reading happened to be mine, proven by content rather than assumed: the stash list in that file named 094509, 092529, 065155, 055442, 231128, 214502, 210007, 190715, 122252, 100506 and 015308, matching this tree's own eleven exactly. The HOT pass went to session-output/ under this root, which is where it belongs. A law seated in the morning and broken by a peer at noon is the argument for the law rather than against it.

file mantra/src/diff.rye the named ceilings, the named error, check_bounds at the edge, split_lines refusing on the line that would pass, and a head that says why each number is that number
file mantra/src/diff_witness.rye claims 8, 9 and 10 -- the boundary pressed at it and one past it, the derivation asserted, and diff's own edge proven to read the check
file tools/fixtures/m/mantra_diff_control.sh three plants -- bound_widened, ceiling_restated, edge_check_removed -- taking the control from seven phases to ten
file tools/m/mantra_diff_witness.rish three claim asserts, three control asserts, and a fence grep so a repair that deletes the constant reds here rather than at a stranger's call site
file construction/REDS.md row 20260907.111135 booked and folded, headline count carried 571 to 572 on the landing rebase; the row is cited by stamp
file construction/archive/REDS-the-fence-the-neighbour-had-rows-572.md the shelf the closed row folded to
file construction/ITINERARY.md the live front carries the finding; the elder account shelved
file construction/archive/20260907-120258_itinerary-landed-accounts.md the elder Patchouli account -- a peer shelved it upstream while this lap sat in a stash, so the duplicate shelf this lap wrote was dropped rather than landed
obs Two more sites the same reading found, named here rather than taken this lap. mantra/src/store.rye read_blob allocates a read buffer at an inline 1024 * 1024 with the comment "1 MiB ceiling for seed" -- a real ceiling wearing no name, so nothing can cite it and nothing can check it. And mantra/src/main.rye carries its own private split_lines at line 217 beside the module's public one, which is one rule spelled twice in one room -- the braid single-stranded names, in the module family whose whole subject is that a quantity spelled twice drifts.
recommend keep-going the anchor-per-insert seam is Keaton's word, so the next agent-doable lap in this lane presses the same boundary at mantra/src/store.rye, whose 1 MiB read ceiling is inline and unnamed, and then at main.rye's duplicate split_lines
