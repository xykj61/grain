title seed privacy remediation + the plan briefs
prompt (Keaton) build the first three; the Yarvin email (with real contacts/family); keep it private, confirm kept out of the seed following the vault succession; and (mid-turn) look at an old prototype to gratitude-silo
think the email surfaced a real leak — his family surname Dunsford, his prior name, personal handles, and contact identifiers were NOT in the scrub list, so the projected seed carried them; the leak scan only checked key material and the maintainer name, never a family name, so it had passed green while leaking
think fixed the scrub honestly — added Dunsford, Michael Dunsford, Mayacama, and the personal handles to sow_scrub.sed (name to role, handle to placeholder); expanded the IDENT safety-net in both the projector and the leak scan to include every family/handle/contact form, and made the withhold-net case-insensitive so a lowercase handle can never slip past a capital-cased rule
think chose privacy over completeness — any file still naming him after scrub is now withheld whole rather than shipped; the per-term recheck reads ALL CLEAN and the leak scan reads IDENT_CLEAN
think did NOT persist his phone, family names, or contact handles to any file — the safest reading of "keep private, following the vault succession" is to hold them for the vault (custody-first, filled by his own hand), not to write plaintext PII to disk; confirmed instead that the seed carries none of it
obs custody-first honored — the seed is clean of his identity, and the raw contact/family details are not written anywhere by me; the vault module (designed this turn) is their proper future home, keyed to his own hand
obs the multi-agent workflow completed — six design briefs landed in active-designing (Vault, Loom, Scribe dashboard + a bat fleet, Starseeding, 3x39/Kumara passports, the name consolidation debride); the Vault brief is especially strong (Shamir GF(256) sharding across location-classes + a brain-derived share, never a master key, custody-first, fake seeds only)
obs held the actual build of the first three — the privacy remediation was the honest priority this turn, and it was not small; the briefs give the first three a clear shape for the next round
obs the xy-mathematics prototype and the Rishi-porting reminder are noted for the baton; I cannot browse that repo from here without a fetch, so its gratitude-silo waits on access or a paste
file tools/fixtures/sow_scrub.sed added Dunsford/Mayacama/family + personal-handle scrubs (name to role, handle to placeholder)
file tools/fixtures/sow_leak_scan.sh · tools/fixtures/sow_project.sh expanded the IDENT net to every identity form; case-insensitive withhold — privacy over completeness
file active-designing/20260810-055147_plan-*.md six next-season design briefs from the workflow (vault, loom, scribe-dashboard, starseeding, passports, name-debride)

recommend check-in Claude — the seed is now provably clean of your identity, family, and handles (IDENT_CLEAN), and your contacts were not written to disk — held for the vault, your own hand. The six design briefs are landed; the first three (Vault first, given today) are ready to build next round. Held for Keaton: whether to publish the seed now (your hand), the xy-mathematics gratitude-silo (needs repo access), and the raw email if you want it kept privately after the vault exists. Thank you everyone
