title Mandate — Kumara-keyed records
prompt (Keaton) kg the Kumara-keyed records
think the integration makes a vector belong to an identity — the store keyed a vector by any u32; keyed.rye makes the key a settled Kumara point, and only the owner may write it
think reused the gate the name registry already proved — the owner presents the point's Deed (verified against the constellation's shared surface via settlement.verify) and signs the exact vector, so possessing an id is never enough to write for another identity
think the signature is over point ++ tag ++ vector-digest (SHA-256 of the f32 bit patterns, little-endian, deterministic across targets), so a tampered vector fails even at the same point and tag
think a search returns point numbers, and place_of resolves each to its place in the fractal — the galaxy, star, or planet the identity settled as; the store stays exactly itself, this layer only decides whose hand may write
obs GREEN on the first build; the planet and star owners each store their own vector, a nearest query returns the planet then the star and both resolve to the right tier, and three refusals hold — a non-owner ghost deed, a forged signature, a tampered vector — while an owner's re-signed upsert updates in place
obs composed settlement.open/mint/verify + the tilak signing over four import symlinks in mandate/ (kumara, kumara_tilak, topology, constellation); mandate/store, mandate/keyed, and the settlement/topology witnesses all stay GREEN together; tame_style_check clean on keyed.rye
obs Keaton asked a fresh batch of design questions mid-build (a .baton scribe extension, unifying Scribe with the glow/rishi/rye tilaks, seating the til folders gen/sur/app/sys/lib/tes, a happy-zone auditing sweep next season, lexicon hz integration) — answered as counsel in the reply, seating what is clear and holding the rest for his word

recommend check-in Claude — Mandate is now identity-owned: a vector belongs to a settled point, only its owner writes it, and search returns who. Next fork: a profile-loaded dimension, an approximate index, serving over Comlink / resolving to a name — or turn to Scribe, whose shape Keaton just asked about (the .baton extension, the til folder layout, unify-with-tilaks). I lean: answer the Scribe design questions first, then build Scribe as the next module, since Mandate's remaining laps are scale/plumbing and Scribe is the flagship home
