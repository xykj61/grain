title The head insert was already booked
prompt autonomous lap -- the baton, the card, and the "unclaimed" reading my own last lap left on it
think Round-open found nothing new to pull; HEAD already stood at 15079a0d5. The claims board carried four live claims, none touching mantra/ or tally/, so no overlap and no claim of my own was owed for a repair to an existing pen.
think My last lap's account left one open, unclaimed line: run is not blind for want of a merge, since an anchorless insert stamps a fresh run with no second site involved, and the record-column guard's blind_reason names the wrong cause for the pair it cannot separate.
think I tried to act on it directly: added a third commit to tools/fixtures/m/mantra_record_column_scan.sh's pen, an anchorless insert of a line named zero, to give run a nonzero value and part it from site's constant zero.
think Proven on metal first: the third commit does give run=2 while site stays 0, so the profile claim holds -- site and run stop sharing a profile once a real store carries this shape.
think Then I tried to make the round trip half of the same guard read clean afterward, and it will not: mantra status on the same unedited file answers 1 added, 1 removed, the same text zero on both lines. Rewriting the working file to the store's own rendered order did not help, because the terminator line keeps the run it was born with and Place.less_than sorts by run first -- so a fresh-run insert always lands past a terminator that never moves, and no ordinary text file can hold content after its own trailing-newline terminator.
think Checked REDS.md before writing this up as new: row %807, stamped 20260917.010830, already books exactly this shape word for word -- store a/b, write zero/a/b, add, status answers the same "1 added, 1 removed, zero on both lines." It names the same mechanism (apply falls back to next_pos, Place sorts by run) and already names three doors, OPEN, Keaton's ruling.
obs So there were two things to get right, not one. The blind_reason correction is real and cheap to state; folding it into the guard by adding a third commit is not cheap, because that shape is %807's own open standfast, not a fresh repair. My last lap's "unclaimed" framing undersold that.
obs Reverted the experimental scan.sh edit rather than leaving a half-finished third commit that could not pass its own round-trip assertion. A guard is not made more honest by teaching it to assert a state the store cannot reach today.
obs Wrote the correction into the standing PATCHOULI account on construction/ITINERARY.md instead of the guard's own files, since the guard's real repair is gated on %807's ruling rather than on a sentence.
rota lap 5406, row 2 -- Fire, the row that sees; what the eye catches. What caught my eye was the same pair (site, run) I had already named, and pressing further showed the fix I proposed walking into a wall already named on the ledger.
file construction/ITINERARY.md the PATCHOULI account gains one paragraph naming %807 as the gate on the record-column guard's own repair, closing the "unclaimed" framing left by the prior lap
scope one measurement, no module or guard file changed -- the record-column guard's blind_reason stays as written, and its repair stays gated on REDS %807's ruling rather than opened as a fresh fix this lap
status GREEN -- pin_bound_touch_scan reads ok on the edited card at 36818 bytes against 40960; no new red booked, since %807 already covers the mechanism measured here; tools/fixtures/m/mantra_record_column_scan.sh reverted byte-identical to its committed state
recommend check in (checkpoint) -- the record-column guard's repair and REDS %807's door choice are one ruling now rather than two; Keaton's word on which door the weave takes settles both at once
