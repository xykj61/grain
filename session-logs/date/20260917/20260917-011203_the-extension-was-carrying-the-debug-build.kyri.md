title The extension was carrying the Debug build
prompt autonomous lap -- diffuser seat, moonshots and research
think Last lap's paper settled two of its elder's falsifiers and wrote four of its own. Falsifier 2 was the one that could have unmade the paper's framing: if Debug still cost 3x ReleaseSafe under -mcpu=baseline, where the SHA-NI extension is absent, then the door was optimization alone and the extension was decoration in the argument. It was named and left standing, which is the Aether row's own subject.
think The counterfactual is clean because the dispatch is a comptime branch. rye/lib/std/crypto/sha2.zig:240 gates an inline-assembly block on builtin.cpu.hasAll(.x86, &.{ .sha, .avx2 }); at baseline the test is false, the block leaves the binary, and the generic Zig round function runs. Nothing else about the program changes.
think Six builds of rye/src/main.rye to scratch paths under .lap/, two targets by three modes, rye/bin/rye left where it stands. Opcode counts confirm the split: native 168 / 58 / 56, baseline 0 / 2 / 0. The fresh native Debug build reproduced the elder paper's own 168 hits and 12,682,680 bytes exactly, from a separate build on a separate lap.
think Fifteen runs per cell through rye key over the same 552 files and 16,416,628 bytes. Cold medians, Debug/ReleaseSafe/ReleaseFast: native 173/70/47, baseline 1318/129/110. Debug costs 2.5x ReleaseSafe with the extension and 10.2x without. Falsifier 2 is refuted; the framing held, and by four times the margin the falsifier was written to test.
think The reading nobody asked for: the extension has been HIDING the Debug penalty. Read Debug at native alone and the shipped configuration looks merely unoptimized at 173 ms; the same build at baseline costs 1318. So a portable-target rye -- what a distributable binary needs, since native bakes in the build host's processor -- pays 7.6x on a cold library read at the mode this tree ships. Mode and portability have been separate questions here and on this operation they multiply.
obs rye passes no -mcpu flag at all: neither bootstrap.sh nor main.rye names one. The extension this tree's hashing speed rests on arrives by default rather than by decision, which is what the card's open question now asks Keaton.
obs The cold endurance run answered guard_red -- 298 green of 321 across 95 minutes, tree_moved=yes, eight ships landing work, several reds already booked elsewhere. This lap adds prose and touches no code, so rather than claim GREEN from that pass I ran the guards my own change touches by name, and the card's account says so in those words.
obs tracked_link read my two new files as living links outside the tree while they sat untracked; it reads the tracked set, so staging is what answered it. The scan was right and the reading was about what had been staged rather than about the links.
obs A tracked build lock, linengrow/.rye-build.lock/pid, vanished under the roster pass and appeared in git status as a deletion. It is no part of my set, so it was unstaged and restored rather than carried along.
obs The baton's ABSENCE clause fired on me twice in one send, both times about the day shelf. My checkout read no date/README-index-20260917.md and no 20260917 row, so I opened the shelf and added rows to the pin and to CHAPTERS.md, and left 20260916 open on the reasoning that a lap begun before midnight could still write into it. The rebase found peers had already opened the day, written three logs into it, and closed 20260916 at 95 rows. Every one of those edits of mine resolved to upstream's, which is the correct outcome and not a reading I took: my row merged in above theirs, their close stands, and the only thing my caution produced was a paragraph that had to be rewritten. A whole-tree grep at a stale HEAD is strong evidence about a tree nobody else is standing in.

rota lap 5190, row 0 -- Aether, the row that hears; listen for the silence where a claim used to be and a witness now stands. My own elder paper had written falsifier 2 and left it standing for a lap, which is exactly that silence, and the lap crossed it rather than writing a new one beside it.

status GREEN on the guards this change touches -- prose_register, ascii_document, link_text_promise, tracked_link, unshared_citation, room_bound, index_row_bound, index_fold all green on metal after staging; the cold endurance run answered guard_red across a moved tree and is reported rather than claimed
recommend keep-going -- the next crux is falsifier 1 of this paper: a pen program hashing a fixed in-memory buffer at both targets, no walk and no file read, which tells whether the 9.2x belongs to SHA256 or to the read loop around it
