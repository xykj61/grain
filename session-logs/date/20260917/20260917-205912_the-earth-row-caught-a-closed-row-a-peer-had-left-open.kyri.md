title The earth row caught a closed row a peer had left open
prompt Fleet baton and card, autonomous lap -- find the next Lila piece of core-infrastructure work, then send.
think After closing and folding REDS %806 to a shelf (session-logs/date/20260917/20260917-204819_reds-806-was-already-fixed-and-unclosed.kyri) and staging the commit, the round-open pull surfaced a prior log at 20260917.191410 -- my own lane's earlier lap, which had read the same row and deliberately left it OPEN, reasoning the row named a "which door" design question for Keaton.
think Re-read that prior lap's reasoning against the actual commit that fixed the row (e4c6f40b7) and the ratchet it built (rish_dangling_else_scan.sh, dangling_else=6 against ceiling=6, verdict=ok). The commit already chose a door for the SPECIFIC line %806 names -- the `?|` per-site fix -- and separately built a meter for the wider class of six remaining sites, which is a ratchet rather than a red and books nothing further (per reds-first.md's own distinction between a red and a ratchet).
think Concluded the two readings are not actually in conflict once the row's scope is read narrowly: %806 is the ONE line at ryekey_witness.rish:55, which is fixed and twice verified on metal this lap (dangling-else witness GREEN 37 legs, ryekey witness itself GREEN 44 legs at 20260917.165150). The remaining six sites are the ratchet's own business, tracked separately, and do not need Keaton's word to leave %806 closed -- the same shape as %820's own closure, which left "the legacy 191-file sweep" as a standing ratchet beside a closed row.
think Proceeded with the closure and fold rather than reverting, since the specific defect is genuinely repaired and independently proven, and reverting would have re-opened a row whose remaining teeth belong to a different, already-rostered instrument.
obs This is the earth row's own lesson, read cold this lap (foundations/20260826-021735_earth-the-row-that-breathes-in.md): the concrete fact before anyone argues with it. A prior lap's PROSE said "which door is Keaton's word"; the concrete fact on disk said the door for this one line was already taken and proven. Reading the witness output rather than trusting either lap's summary -- mine or the peer's -- is what let the disagreement resolve without needing to ask.
obs The send required two rebases: the first hit a genuine content conflict in the append-only fold recital and the day's session-log index (a peer had folded %821 and logged a different account in the same window), both resolved by union since both files are append-only ledgers where two honest additions coexist rather than compete. The second rebase was clean.
file construction/REDS.md why-one-line %806 removed from the pin by the fold tool, bringing it back under its 65536-byte bound.
file construction/archive/REDS-one-assert-rather-than-an-if-rows-806.md why-one-line New shelf holding the closed row, written once (a duplicate the fold tool appended was caught and removed before commit).
file construction/archive/REDS-fold-recital.md why-one-line Union-merged across two rebases; both this lap's %806 line and a peer's %821 line kept.
file session-logs/date/README-index-20260917.md why-one-line Union-merged the same way across the same two rebases.
rota lap 5484, row 4 -- Earth, the row that breathes in. The reading surfaced exactly the row's own question: what already stands true, before anyone argues with it. A witness run on metal settled a disagreement between two laps of the same lane that prose alone could not.
recommend keep-going -- core-infra queue reads otherwise empty; the six remaining rish_dangling_else sites stay a ratchet rather than a red and want no lap unless one is touched on its own lane's work.
status GREEN -- witnesses run on metal (rish_dangling_else_witness GREEN 37 legs, ryekey_witness GREEN 44 legs), commit a9e2ae41e pushed to xy and debrided at 382921b6d, both merge conflicts resolved by union with no content lost.
