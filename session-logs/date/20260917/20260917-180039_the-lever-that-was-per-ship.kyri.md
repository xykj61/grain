title The lever that was per ship
prompt Load the incense ship context and the most recent expanding prompt; open a fresh captain session; either take the other seven ships down to Sonnet 5 and web-check for a Claude Code upgrade for an outer-terminal rebuild, or wait for every lap to finish and bring them all down together.
think The question posed two doors and assumed one shared switch behind both. Measurement turned it over: .claude/settings.json is TRACKED and byte-identical in all eight clones, so moving the model there moves incense too and reddens declared_model_scan, whose declaring roster names three living pages. .claude/settings.local.json is denied by .gitignore line 146 and held by none of the eight; it overrides the tracked file and the gate reads only settings.json, which tools/fixtures/d/declared_model_scan.sh states in its own header at line 44.
think A lap is a fresh `claude -p` invocation per iteration -- tools/f/fleet-loop.sh line 250 and tools/f/fleet_lap.sh line 47 -- so a local settings file written mid-flight is read by each ship at its NEXT lap. That is what dissolved the either/or: nothing needed to come down and nothing in flight was disturbed, so the waiting door bought nothing the acting door did not already give.
think The upgrade was read from Anthropic's own release path rather than from memory, exactly as the overlay's own comment instructs: latest answers 2.1.274 against the pier's pinned 2.1.235, and the per-version manifest names the linux-x64 sha256.
think The checksum was verified on metal rather than copied. Running the download to read its version failed with `Could not start dynamically linked executable`, which is the stub-ld refusal the overlay's own comment block already names -- so the version string is proven by versionCheckHook at build time and the checksum is what a hand can prove before it. Both halves are now written into the comment, because the elder text claimed metal verification without naming which half a hand can actually reach.
obs The seven peers were all mid-lap and all building, read from the upstream claim board: overlap_peer=0 on nixos/, so this lap collided with nobody and needed no claim of its own -- a host-config bump is neither a new instrument nor a booked red.
obs No ruling was taken on quality. Sonnet 5 across seven lanes is Keaton's word, made on his own answer; what this lap settled is only that the lever is per ship, reversible by deleting one untracked file, and costs no tracked byte.
loom claude_code_download=2.1.274 bytes=230580536 sha256_match=yes
file nixos/configuration.nix the claude-code overlay's version and src move 2.1.235 -> 2.1.274 with the new sha256, and the comment block gains the paragraph separating what a hand verifies from what the build verifies
file nixos/rebuild-outer.sh step 4's expected version string follows the pin, so the outer runner keeps telling the truth about what it should print
recommend check-in (Keaton) -- the rebuild is an outer-terminal hand: `sudo cp nixos/configuration.nix /etc/nixos/configuration.nix` then `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`, with running loops holding their open inode and taking 2.1.274 on their next lap.
