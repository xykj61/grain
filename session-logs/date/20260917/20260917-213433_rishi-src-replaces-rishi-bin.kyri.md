title rishi/src replaces rishi/bin in ten root-finders (%788, in-lane)
prompt No explicit user message this turn -- the baton alone, as an autonomous fleet lap.
think Round-opened: fetched xy, ran fleet_round_open.sh, landed clean at ee90585d0.
think Checked fleet-claims.kyri: no live claims. Read ITINERARY.md whole for Now/Next.
think Every explicit BAKERY-tagged item on the card was already closed or handed to Diffuser -- my own agent-doable queue read empty.
think Per CLAIM-AS-OVERRIDE, scanned REDS.md's eighteen OPEN rows for an unclaimed, in-lane, Keaton-word-free crux. Most wanted a design ruling or belonged to another ship's module.
think REDS %788 named a real defect squarely in Bakery's toolchain lane: 77 shell root-finders test for `rishi/bin`, an untracked build artifact, so they refuse in any checkout nobody has built. The row itself named the one-word fix but flagged the full sweep as fleet-wide timing, not one ship's call.
think Filtered the 77 to the ten that sit inside Bakery's own domain (rye_*, caravan_*, one Mantra/Tablecloth control) and took only those, leaving the rest for their owning ships -- the card's own rule.
think Changed the directory test from rishi/bin to rishi/src (tracked, present in every checkout) plus the matching error text, in all ten files.
think Ran each scan/control directly first; two paired controls (rye_harness_roster, rye_compile_reach) still planted rishi/bin inside their own pen builders and their witnesses reddened -- caught by running the pair rather than trusting the lone scan. Fixed both pen builders and rye_witness_walker_control.sh's pen builder the same way (it also builds a pen tree).
think Confirmed rye_compiled_reach_scan.sh's own over_ceiling reading and rye_compile_reach_control.sh needing args are pre-existing, unrelated to this change, by running the same commands against a stash of the unmodified tree.
think Ran caravan_allowance_widen_control.sh and caravan_address_space_join_control.sh with real zig/pen arguments -- both green.
think Wrote a short BAKERY account into ITINERARY.md naming the ten files, the 77-to-67 count, and the remainder left to other ships.
think Committed, then carried the Git nib forward with remember_git_nib.rish write amend, per rule 2.
think Fetch-before-push found the pier landing a peer commit roughly every 10-20 seconds; rebased three times (one genuine conflict on the Git nib line, two clean), paying the readme_metrics/geode_libraries/pin-bound debts and re-amending the nib after each rebase, until a push finally landed cleanly.
obs A peer ship (REDS %820) closed a sibling class of the same defect in parallel -- seven newly-created files that had copied the broken rishi/bin idiom from a neighbor -- independently confirming the diagnosis and the rishi/src cure while I was mid-lap on the legacy files.
obs The fleet's push cadence made the ORDER stanza's ideal (claim, then one settled cold run) hard to realize for a small mid-cadence repair; I chose to verify only the specific scans/controls/witnesses touched rather than launch a full cold endurance run, since the change was narrow, mechanical, and each affected instrument was re-run GREEN on metal directly.

rota lap 5410, row 0 -- Aether, the row that hears: reading REDS.md's OPEN rows for an unclaimed lap is itself a listening pass -- most rows asked for Keaton's word rather than a builder's hand, and the one row that answered was the one already speaking plainly about its own repair.

file construction/ITINERARY.md -- new BAKERY account naming the in-lane repair; Git nib carried forward through three rebases
scope Ten toolchain files repaired and verified; commit landed on both xy and debrided.
status GREEN -- every touched scan, control, and .rish witness re-run and passing after the change; no full fleet-wide cold endurance run launched for this narrow, mechanical repair.
recommend keep-going -- the remaining 67 rishi/bin sites sit in other ships' lanes; my own queue is empty again pending the next OPEN row or claim.
