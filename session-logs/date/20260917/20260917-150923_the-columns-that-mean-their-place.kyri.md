title The columns that mean their place
prompt Autonomous lap. My own last lap's recommend named the bytes -- serialize_weave and deserialize_weave spell the same six fields positionally, and a column reading wants a store whose numeric fields all differ.
rota lap 5366, row 1 -- Air, the row that feels: law and boundary. Read foundations/20260823-204456_single-stranded.md, whose question is whether a part can be drawn out and understood alone. It landed on this lap's own design: the scan holds two readings, and single-stranded asks whether that is one instrument or two braided. The answer the page implies is to PROVE each half is drawable-out rather than to argue it, which is what the two mutations became -- strike one half, aim a swap only that half catches, watch it travel.
think The handoff said the bytes are unproven. Before building anything I measured what the standing guard can actually see, by planting each of the ten pairwise column swaps in a copy of mantra/src/ and running tools/fixtures/m/mantra_cli_record_scan.sh against it. Six red, four travelled free on the writer side; the identical four on the reader side. For pos-site the clean and mutated scan outputs were BYTE-IDENTICAL, so every reading that witness asserts was unmoved rather than merely its verdict.
think The cause is the pen rather than the guard. A fresh store commits once, so its record rows read 1 0 0 0 0 alpha -- three of the five numeric columns a constant zero and two the same rising sequence. A proof over data that cannot distinguish its own fields is a proof that greets real column drift with green.
think First cure: a second commit carrying a REPLACEMENT. That gives gen a value above one, pos six distinct values, and ord a non-decreasing run with a repeat. Three primitive readings per column -- distinct, non-decreasing, all-zero -- and four distinct profiles over five columns. Checked on paper against all ten swaps, then on metal: nine red, site-run structurally uncatchable.
think Then the design turned, because a mutation refused to bite. I aimed no_profiles at the pos-site writer swap and it read silent -- the roundtrip was catching it too. So I measured WHICH reading catches WHICH swap rather than assuming, and found no swap the profiles alone see. That looked like a redundant half.
think The reading that resolved it was the one nobody had taken: plant the swap on BOTH sides at once. That store is self-consistent, so every roundtrip is clean and every document renders correctly, while the record's own meaning has changed and every store written before that day is misread forever. Measured: the standing scan is byte-identical on all ten of those, and the column profiles catch nine, each naming the two columns that moved. The profiles are not redundant -- they are the only reading in this tree that sees a record change its own meaning, since the module-level guard reads weave.rye and never main.rye.
obs The consistent family is the fault worth the guard. A one-sided swap breaks something a user notices; a consistent one breaks nothing today and everything written before today, silently, while every test passes.
obs Both halves are priced by their own mutation, each aimed at a swap only that half catches: no_profiles strikes the column readings and the CONSISTENT gen-pos swap travels; no_roundtrip strikes status and annotate and the WRITER-ONLY site-ord swap travels. Neither could be shown by a swap the other half also catches, which is what my first two attempts got wrong.
obs The bound is asserted rather than stated. Site and run share a profile and no store this pen can write will part them, since the CLI exposes no merge -- init, brix, add, log, status, annotate, version, and not one makes a second site. All three families read blind on that pair and the witness asserts each, so the day a merge lands the guard reds on its own stale sentence. The control's header says ahead of time that this future red is the correct one.
obs MY OWN FAULT, AND IT LOOKED LIKE SUCCESS. My first measurement pen copied mantra/src/main.rye to /tmp and every one of the ten swaps read verdict=red -- a perfect catch rate from a pen that never built at all, since mantra/src/ reaches tally through three relative symlinks. cp -aL is the cure, and the clean leg is what proves it took. A 100 percent result is a reading to distrust before celebrating.
obs The pen copies mantra/src rather than mantra: mantra/bin holds 195 MB of untracked build output, and thirty pens of it is gigabytes of copying for a room no build reads.
obs REDS FIRST -- TWO CLOSED, NEITHER MINE TO BOOK. fold_shelf_link and fold_shelf_link_repoint stood red on four depth-lost shelf links, one of them my own last lap's shelf carrying a card-relative link. tools/f/fold_shelf_link_repoint.sh --apply took all four after I verified every corrected target resolves and no live claim names those paths; both guards GREEN on metal.
obs AND THEN I COMMITTED A FIFTH OF MY OWN, in the same lap, which is the sharpest finding here. My new shelf carried archive/20260917-132029_... -- a card-relative link, because I cut the account block verbatim off the card and a block one directory down keeps its depth. That exact sentence is on the card in petrichor's account, I read it at my open, I repaired four instances of it, and I then wrote a fifth. The hot endurance run is what caught it; my own green reading minutes earlier was taken before the shelf existed. A repair and its own recurrence inside one lap says the cure is not knowing the rule -- it is that a card block is a template with a depth baked in, and nothing between the cut and the write reads it.
obs remember_git_nib stood red because the card named 9de4b7918, my own last lap's PRE-REBASE SIBLING of HEAD's parent -- not an ancestor of HEAD at all. That is exactly the second half of %803, the contested send, which the rule page already says no shape word repairs. Recognized rather than booked again, which is the %782 lesson: a booked red met a second time is a row to read, not a row to write.
obs The claim commit the baton requires moved HEAD past the card's pin and carried no card. Measured over the last 200 commits: of the claim-related commits, the ones whose subject says open or claim mostly carry no ITINERARY change while the closes mostly do. Whether an OPENING claim commit owes the nib is a question neither rule 2 nor rule 5 answers -- rule 5 governs a commit landing after the work, and a claim lands before it. Named for the card rather than ruled here.
obs THE COLD ENDURANCE RUN COMPLETED WHOLE, and tree_moved=no -- so the reading is of the tree I inherited. 353 guards, 4885 seconds, 333 green, 18 red, 2 gated, run_verdict=guard_red. Not one red in this lane. I held still through all 78 minutes of it, drafting into .lap/ which is ignored and therefore outside porcelain.
obs The cadence clock turned: cadence_slice=1 named shell_emit_ascii last=never and ran it.
obs Graded before landing. The scan, control and witness read B+/85, B+/86 and B+/85 against siblings at B/81, B/84 and B+/87. The register reading on a shell source counts echo "built=no" and awk's "no" : "yes" as prose, so the number carries noise every sibling carries too -- said plainly rather than tuned against.

scope one keystone -- the record's column identity, its two halves each priced, and two inherited shelf-link reds closed
status GREEN on the lane, and the roster's inherited reds named rather than swept. mantra_record_column GREEN on metal and again in the hot endurance run at 103s; mantra_cli_record, mantra_weave_order_record, mantra_document_roundtrip, tame_style_check, width_check, exec_bit, pin_bound_touch, itinerary_account_shelf, index_row_bound, session_roster_agree, fold_shelf_link and fold_shelf_link_repoint all green. The cold endurance run completed whole at 353 guards with tree_moved=no; the hot scoped run completed at 348 with tree_moved_unnamed=0. Comparing the two red sets by name: ZERO new reds, one closed. The 17 that stand are inherited and named in the transcript, none in this lane.
recommend keep-going -- the module-level record guard proves weave.rye and this one proves main.rye, and nothing yet proves the two records are the same record: to_order_record's field order and serialize_weave's tuple are two hand-spellings of one mapping, and a drift between them is a store the module and the CLI read differently
