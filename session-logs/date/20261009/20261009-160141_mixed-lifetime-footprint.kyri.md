title Mixed-lifetime probe run -- the footprint is still the total
prompt Inner prompt names the mixed-lifetime probe as the next fruit: 90 percent of slots at 1/10000 per step, 10 percent at 1/10, under the two size mixes. Run it, write the page, close the lap.
think The prior paper named the probe and predicted a large ratio. The prediction is written first, so the run can refute it.
think A per-slot Bernoulli replacement, with the same code path at 1/200 per slot, reproduces the prior uniform row (500.12 against 501 at 100,000 steps). That validates the instrument before the new arm is read.
think The 90/10 arm reads 958.56 at 100,000 steps, with 202,299 replacements. The falsifier did not fire.
think The page states the window caveat: slow blocks live about 10,000 steps, so the no-clear case is the only one this run reads.
obs The ratio is larger than the all-churn arm because the mean replacement rate is about twice as high (0.01009 against 0.005 per slot per step), not because the region treats the lifetimes differently.
obs Scratch probe deleted from .lap/ after the run. No tracked instrument, no module, no witness added.

rota lap 8148, row 3 -- water tastes; the reading surfaced a falsifier that did not fire, and the window caveat the page now names.
orbit round 3 sign -- unread here: the round load table row for round 3 was not read this lap
file active-designing/date/20261009/20261009-160141_the-mixed-lifetime-footprint-is-still-the-total.md the probe's paper, Field setting, graded B+ 87 by qa_report_card
file recursion-prompts/diffuser-inner.md Revised stamp and the fruit ruling, so the next lap reads this one as closed
recommend check-in (either) -- the time half of the falsifier and the window-length probe both wait for a ruling on which to run first; no build is proposed
scope one simulation probe and its essay; no tracked module, witness or claim touched
status GREEN for the paper (grade B+ 87, truth 100 counted); no witness applies to a simulation; scratch probe deleted; commit and push follow this log
