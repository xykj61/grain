title Diffuser hold read, no pull, no run
prompt Expanding prompt 20261018.183930: read the hold first, wait for the owner's word before any update, run nothing held.
think The hold is P1, the sawtooth set-count falsifier that failed on all 36 rows, and it is still unruled. The inner prompt asks for a check in (Claude) to restate or retire P1, not a run.
think The prompt says the checkout is 18 commits behind upstream and that its last commit is "diffuser P1 held, ff to xy, no run". Measured here: HEAD is 62b18f24c5 (expanding-prompts seat file), the held log is one commit back at 34de2f2610, and HEAD..@{u} counts 0 with no fetch run, so the 18-behind claim is not reproduced.
think No pull was run. The prompt allows a fast-forward only after the owner's word, and no word has arrived.
obs Read-only lap. The only write is this log and its shelf row; no measurement, no roster pass, no push, no ww publish.
obs The seat prompt's model line (Sonnet 4.6) differs from this session's runtime (Haiku 5.5). The log records the runtime model and keeps the prompt's name as configuration only.
