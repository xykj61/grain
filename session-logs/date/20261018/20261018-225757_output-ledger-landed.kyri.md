title construction/OUTPUT.md fix and send -- ledger lands at xy/main
prompt (context resumed) fix tally/sign_checked.rye path and land the commit
think prior session left four files staged but commit refused: body cited `tally/sign_checked.rye` which does not exist; `sign_checked` lives in `tally/kumara.rye` per `git show fda5a4b03e`
think fixed OUTPUT.md row to read `tally/kumara.rye`; re-staged; rewrote commit body to avoid citing the wrong path
think commit landed at `539f108895`; push rejected (peer commits landed); fetched and rebased
think index conflict in `session-logs/date/README-index-20261018.md` -- peer wrote row `20261018.225030`; ours wrote row `20261018.225332`; resolved by keeping both with ours first (newer stamp)
think rebased and pushed cleanly to `6db8253a30`
obs the wrong path was introduced when seeding from memory rather than from `git show`; the commit-msg hook caught it correctly -- the wall did its job
obs index conflict is ordinary on a fleet of eight ships; resolved by stamp order (newest first)
file construction/OUTPUT.md fixed: `tally/kumara.rye` nib `fda5a4b03e`; landed at `6db8253a30`
file session-logs/date/README-index-20261018.md conflict resolved; both rows kept
recommend kg -- OUTPUT.md is live; next lap can start appending rows or read the ratio question's open questions
