title Cursor Grok usage rate compared
prompt which one is the usage rate higher for
think compare the current official Cursor pricing tables for Grok 4.7 and Grok 4.6, including the long-context tier
obs standard and fast per-token rates are equal for Grok 4.7 and Grok 4.6; Grok 4.7 long-context pricing is higher
obs the local launcher selects grok-4.7-high, whose effort setting may consume more tokens in practice but is not listed as a separate per-token price
file session-logs/date/20260921/20260921-154545_cursor-usage-rate-compared.kyri this record
recommend use standard Grok 4.7 or Grok 4.6 pricing when comparing like-for-like; avoid the 500k long-context tier when minimizing usage
scope Cursor model usage-rate comparison; no repository behavior change
