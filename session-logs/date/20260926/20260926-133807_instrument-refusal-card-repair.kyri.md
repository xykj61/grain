title the instrument_refusal wall was closed a lap ago and the card still said open
prompt Continue the incense inner loop: round-open, claim, cold run, build, send, log.
think Round-opened clean at a7c191e119; five session logs and 13 files in the dead-letter box, none touching this lap.
think Checked the claim board -- five standing rows, all status=stale, no overlap.
think Per ORDER, tried to launch the cold run and found one already in flight, launched at this lap's own launch HEAD (a7c191e119) -- the exact match ORDER asks for, so held still and waited rather than starting a second or TERMing it.
think While waiting, read construction/ITINERARY.md's Open doors for Keaton section rather than the OPEN REDS rows, since every OPEN row still wants Keaton's word or belongs to another lane.
think Found a stale bullet: it still named fallback_instrument_passes=4 from 20260917.090914 as unclaimed drift in fleet_claim_form_control.sh and page_residency_sample.sh.
think Ran tools/fixtures/i/instrument_refusal_scan.sh fresh: fallback_instrument_passes=0, verdict=ok -- commit f4972ff9a (the prior lap in this same shelf) already repaired it.
think Also checked the th5/width-check disagreement named in the open doors -- confirmed tools/w/width_check_th5.rish RED on metal against tools/fixtures/w/width_check_scan.sh's pinned five-usize exemption, but left it alone since the card names it as TAME's/Keaton's own ruling to make, not a lap's to resolve unilaterally.
think Rewrote the stale bullet to name the closed reading and the repairing commit hash, per docs-implementation-sync (assert it, don't assume it).
think The commit-msg hook refused the first draft for carrying only one mechanism word; rewrote the body naming file, argument, and script explicitly, and it passed.
think Amended the Git nib to HEAD's parent via remember_git_nib.rish write amend, staged the one changed line, amended the commit.
think Fetched xy clean (ahead 1, no divergence), pushed xy then debrided, both fast-forward.
think Named honestly: this lap edited and pushed while the inherited cold run (launched at this lap's own HEAD) was still in flight in the background -- the same shape several prior laps in this shelf have named from the launching side. Its tree_moved reading, once it lands, may describe a tree this lap itself moved.
obs No REDS row booked -- this was an ordinary documentation-sync repair against an already-fixed defect, not a fresh finding. The card's own byte bound stayed well under ceiling (39,849 of 40,960) both before and after.
obs The th5 width-instrument disagreement stays open and unclaimed -- a genuine RED on metal that the card itself flags as a ruling rather than a repair, so it was read and left named rather than resolved.
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- rewrote the stale instrument_refusal bullet to name the closed wall and the repairing commit, and carried the Git nib forward to HEAD's parent.
scope one stale card bullet repaired against an already-landed fix; no code changed; the in-flight inherited cold run's verdict still pending at send time.
status green on the one change made -- fallback_instrument_passes=0 confirmed fresh, tame_style_check untouched (no code), commit and push clean fast-forward on both remotes.
recommend keep-going -- a fresh round-open and a cold run held still start to finish; the standing lead reverts to the ledger fold deadlock (still Keaton's word to break) or whatever the in-flight cold run's receipt surfaces as fresh red once it lands.
