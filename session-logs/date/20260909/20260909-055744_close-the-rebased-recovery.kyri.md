title Close the rebased recovery
prompt Close the lap with its record, preserve parked work, and push xy then debrided
obs The commit adds a checkpoint, replaces a duplicated card paragraph with its session-log link, and updates the Git nib to this commit's parent.
obs The prior recovery and regression commits are signed. A peer advanced xy before the push; two pulls rebased both commits, with only the Git nib conflicting on the final work commit.
obs The post-rebase pin check found ITINERARY at 41372 bytes against 40960. The checkpoint names the exact Git version of the removed paragraph; the existing day-shelf record retains its findings and verification limit. No file was moved.
obs Both generated pages were refreshed after the rebase and stayed byte-identical. All original stashes and the retained autostash backup remain.
obs The main record is session-logs/date/20260909/20260909-044210_prose-is-not-a-builder.kyri. Its two full-pass failures were repaired and the named hot checks passed; a fresh full-roster confirmation remains for the next lap.
rota none -- this follow-up closes transport and the pin bound; the Water reading is recorded in the main lap log

file session-logs/date/README-index-20260909.md give this follow-up its own shelf row
recommend keep-going Run a fresh full roster first; the main lap records the repaired failures and preserved compiler-census evidence.
scope Close the rebased recovery, restore the card bound, and send the signed commits to both remotes.
status SCOPED -- repaired witnesses and named hot checks pass; pin, index, and nib checks precede this send; full-roster confirmation remains.
