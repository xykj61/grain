title The search that swallowed its error
prompt Recover Grass parked work, audit within its lane, close with a session log and commit, and push xy then debrided
rota lap 4429, row 4 -- Earth, the concrete; the threshold and three readings surfaced the distinction between a search that found no caller and a search that could not read callers
obs The shim_reason scan script now checks the caller-search exit code, withholds counts on an error, and prints Git's original stderr. Its control function injects errors after partial output; its witness asserts the refusal and the ordinary no-match case.
obs The old caller loop continued after git grep exited above 1. Both planted errors, 2 and 128, returned verdict=ok with reason_lost_rostered=0 and lost their diagnostic. This was an instrument failure reported as a clean population.
obs The repaired scan exits 2 with verdict=instrument_refusal for both plants. A real search with no callers remains accepted; restoring the search finds the witness that drops stderr, and forwarding stderr frees that repository.
obs The new witness run against the old scanner exits 1 at caller_2_exit. The restored scanner passes all 98 readings across 22 repositories. The success messages now name the matched forms instead of claiming every possible diagnostic path.
obs Scope stays with the existing top-level text patterns. Alternate bindings, commented matches, and other instrument operations remain separate audit questions.
obs Read all eight stash file lists, the remaining parked log, and the newest Grass transcript. The identity control's executable body already landed; the current copy corrects two comments and its mode. The previous Grass logs record recovery or supersession of the other code packages. All eight stashes and the named recovery branch remain.
obs The one unlanded historical log and six orphan fold shelves remain parked at the existing historical-record gate, REDS %636. The closed-day shelves and old log fields were kept whole.
obs The first detached runner process disappeared before producing a reading. Relaunched with its printed pid held by the calling shell; the completed transcript carries the current eight stash entries and matches git stash list.
obs Cold pass at 002497bf07: shell_dialect expected 47 passing checks while two were skipped without rg; Amphora's disagree plant passed without rg; stash_record held the historical log; standing_equipment summarized those findings and an elder dated_path red plus an unrostered fleet_drain record.
obs An installed ripgrep binary was outside this shell's PATH. Added its existing Nix store bin directory to this lap's test environment. Both shell_dialect and amphora_bounds_agree pass with that tool present. Copal's and Bakery's named transcripts were read; their tracked files were kept with their lanes.
obs Fetched xy and debrided after the cold pass and fast-forwarded the clean tree to b0dd10bdaf, Incense's parked-package recovery. Its added controls and witnesses will be covered by the full hot pass.
obs The ledger pin holds 40787 of 40960 bytes with its live rows open. The caller-search finding's full three-part draft stays in this seat's output room; a fold is held by the existing dated-path gate, so this lap leaves the ledger bound intact.

obs The hot source files and index held still. After the run, this log alone received its measured hot totals and closing status; the record checks run again before committing.
obs Rebased over f853fed32b, the peer query-budget design. All three tested tool files remain byte-identical to the hot-tested work commit; both day rows remain in order. The merged record checks repeat before the send.

recommend keep-going -- audit the remaining stderr-forwarding text patterns; preserve the historical-log gate and parked bytes; carry rg explicitly in this shell's PATH
scope One diagnostic caller-search repair, its control and witness, a stash recovery audit, and the lap's records
status TESTED -- shim_reason passes 98 control readings; the old scanner fails the new witness; QA passes 155 behaviors. Full hot: 204 green, two red, two gated, tree_moved=no. Both environment reds pass with rg restored. Historical-log custody and the roster summary remain open; its evidence also names the elder dated_path red and unrostered fleet_drain record.
