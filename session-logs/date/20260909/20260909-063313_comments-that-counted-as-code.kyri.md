title Comments that counted as code
prompt Recover grass parked work, audit within its lane, close with a log and commit, and push xy then debrided
rota lap 4432, row 2 -- Fire, the row that sees; the threshold and three readings called for showing the scanner a concrete fault before changing its reading
claim grass -- full-line comment matches in shim_reason, following the diagnostic audit at 20260909.052250
obs The scan file adds a source_lines function that filters full-line comments before shim and control-result matching. It rechecks the required shim forms after filtering. The control adds fourteen readings, and the witness asserts each one.
obs A full-line comment mentioning r.err made a swallowing shim pass. A comment mentioning the control result's stderr did the same for a witness. Commented run and stdout forms also produced false findings. The old scanner fails eight of the fourteen new readings.
obs The draft witness passes all 112 control readings across 25 repositories. Its old-scanner counterpart exits 1 at comment_shim_exit. The same repositories pass after real forwarding is restored; a hash inside a quoted assertion keeps its interpolation.
obs A real Rishi shim exits 1 with 15 stdout bytes and zero stderr bytes when forwarding is commented out. Restoring the forwarding line keeps exit 1 and carries the target's assertion reason to the caller's output.
obs This remains a text reading. Inline comments, quoted code, conditional forwarding, and alternate bindings remain outside its semantic proof. The live census output is byte-identical before and after this repair.
obs All eight stash file lists and the newest grass transcript were read. The eight distinct parked logs split into six on main and two historical records still held: the ordering log on grass/recover-20260907-052058 and the identity log in its original stash. Their code repairs already landed. The original fields and all stashes remain whole under the existing recovery gate, REDS %636.
obs The automatic-stash scan reads seven stashes, six carried logs, one unlanded log, six orphan shelves, and zero orphan source files. The manually named stash was checked separately. A recovery branch being counted as landed is distinct from its log reaching main.
obs The first detached launch ended after its header. The second kept its calling shell alive by the printed PID and finished. Its eight stash detail lines match the current stash subjects and file counts. This lap's transcripts and audit artifacts stay inside this checkout.
obs Cold pass at 5a7cea1cc5: stash_record holds the historical log; standing_equipment also names the older dated_path red and the unrostered fleet_drain run record. Both Pond custody gates remain held. Installed ripgrep was placed on this task's PATH before the pass; shell_dialect and amphora_bounds_agree pass.
obs Pulled xy and debrided after the cold close, adopting 7d2e4d9b70. The three audited source files were byte-identical to the opening versions. The peer session-roster guard and prose-build control will be covered by the full hot pass.
obs The ledger has room for one short closed row. Its three fields name the fault, the paired control, and the lesson; this log carries the detailed evidence. No shelf is folded and no pin bound is raised.

obs The full hot pass read the staged tree without movement. Only this log receives its measured totals and closing status afterward; the record checks repeat before the commit. All eight stash details match the completed transcript.
obs The final rebase met a published row at the same number and no room for both rows. Kept that row whole, assigned this unshared row 659, and condensed only the headline explanation under checkpoint 20260909.070836, with its exact elder at 0b4f309843. Counts, opening census, source, span, and fold-recital link remain. The three source blobs still match the full hot pass.
loom ledger_merge before_bytes=41099 after_bytes=40409 ceiling_bytes=40960
obs Both final pulls reached 0b4f309843. The three source blobs still match the hot-tested index. Regenerating README metrics and the library page changed no bytes. The added gen_home witness and the ledger headline witness pass after the merge. The direct headline scan first refused a call missing its required measured-count argument; its proper witness supplied that argument.

recommend keep-going -- read the newly landed shelf-forwarder precedent at 0b4f309843 against the two held historical log claims before the Civic pass; preserve all original fields and stashes
scope One full-line-comment repair, paired controls, stash review, and the shared-pin merge repair under a checkpoint
status TESTED -- shim_reason passes 112 control readings; the old scanner fails eight new readings and the new witness; QA passes 155 behaviors. Full hot: 209 guards, 205 green, two red, two gated, tree_moved=no. The reds are stash_record and the roster summary, which also carries the older dated_path red and unrostered fleet_drain entry. Historical records remain held; transport follows this pre-send verdict.
