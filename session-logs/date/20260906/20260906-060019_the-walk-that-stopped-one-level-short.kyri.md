title The walk that stopped one level short
prompt The baton -- take the next agent-doable lap in the language lane, reds first.

think Opened with tools/f/fleet_round_open.sh before reading anything. Already on the anointed order, open on 82c546b4ca, nothing stashed and nothing to adopt. So the card I read is the tree I stand on.
think Reds first. Of the ten rows on the pin, %450 %461 %462 were CLOSED, and every OPEN row in my lane waits on Keaton -- %460 at the qemu question, the Mantra identity gap at the Line seam, glow/rune_shape.rye width custody. So the queue that is mine and ungated is the one the card names: %463's census accused exactly one file.
think That accusation is the whole lap's thread. My own last lap measured 1,713 distinct .rye files and found ONE carrying a runner's claim with nothing compiling it -- mantra/src/diff.rye. A census that names a file and stops there has done half a job.

obs I BUILT IT, AND IT DOES NOT COMPILE. Three sites in mantra/src/diff.rye write `var deletes = std.ArrayListUnmanaged(u32){};` -- the elder init form, which Zig 0.16 refuses with *missing struct field: items*. That is REDS %449's exact shape one file over: weave.rye carried it in Weave.empty() and Patchouli repaired it last night. diff.rye carried it three times and nothing anywhere built it.
obs THE PROBE I WROTE FIRST WAS THE ONE I LEARNED TO WRITE LAST LAP. Last lap I called diff.rye type-checked off an importing probe and retracted it before shipping, because Zig analyses lazily and the probe walked past a planted type error. So this lap's probe references every declaration by taking its ADDRESS, which is what forces analysis -- and I tested the probe rather than trusting it: planted a type error in a new top-level declaration (reds), planted one inside an existing function body (reds), and ran the repaired file (greens, binary runs). A probe proven in one direction cannot be told from a probe that always reds.
obs AND THEN THE PROBE ITSELF WAS TOO SHALLOW, WHICH IS THIS LAP'S RED. I ran the same one-level walk over mantra/src/store.rye and it read GREEN. That greenness is false: std.meta.declarations publishes a CONTAINER's own declarations, and a method is a declaration of the STRUCT rather than of the module -- so the walk saw `Store` the type and never `Store.read_head` the function. Making the walk recursive found two real errors in store.rye on the first run: std.mem.trimRight, renamed trimEnd in this toolchain, and `return allocator.dupe(u8, name)` bare from a function declaring `!?[]u8`, where the optional wants a try.
obs THE LESSON IS ONE TURN PAST %463's. There the census answered ZERO of everything and read as health. Here the walk answered PARTIALLY and read as health, which is worse, because a partial answer carries a real count and a real file list -- nothing about it looks wrong. THE DEPTH OF AN INSTRUMENT DECIDES WHAT IT CAN SEE. This tree keeps most of its code in methods on a struct, so a walk one level deep is blind to most of what it claims to check.
obs I CHECKED THE WHOLE ROOM RATHER THAN THE ACCUSED FILE ALONE, and that is what found the second one. weave.rye and main.rye walk clean recursively; diff.rye and store.rye did not. The census could only ever have named diff.rye, because store.rye IS reached -- main.rye imports it -- and reached is not analyzed. That gap is the row's booked remainder.
obs THE INSTRUMENT NOW LIVES IN THE TREE. mantra/src/declaration_walk_witness.rye walks all four modules, descends into containers to a named max_walk_depth of 8, and takes each declaration's address. It COUNTS what it walked -- 19: weave 9, diff 2, store 7, main 1 -- and asserts min_room_declarations at 16, because a walk that counts nothing reports everything sound. That floor is %463's lesson written into the successor instrument on the lap after it.
obs THE CONTROL PROVES THE DESCENT IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DECORATION. Nine behaviors in a pen: clean greens (pen innocent); five faults each refuse -- the elder init form, the renamed std function, the dropped try, a top-level type error, a fault inside a struct method; the floor is free at the measured 19 and bites at 20. The ninth is the one worth having: the SAME method-level fault fed to a one-level walk, which exits 0. Without that phase the recursion is a design choice nobody measured; with it, the shallow walk's blindness is a number.
obs THE RYE WITNESS SITS BESIDE ITS MODULES BECAUSE ZIG MAKES IT. An import may not escape the root file's directory, so a witness one room away would have to copy the module -- and a copy proves the copy, which is exactly how rye/tests/mantra_weave_test.rye migrated with the toolchain while weave.rye rotted. Patchouli named that in the merge guard's header last night; this guard obeys the same constraint for the same reason.
obs GRADED WHAT I TOUCHED AND WORKED THE FRAME DOWN. The Rye witness read C/74 and the Rishi guard C/74, both on Register -- 66% negative of nine sentences in each module head. That is honest rather than %451's artifact, since neither head writes a bullet. Rewrote both heads to lead with what is, holding every claim, path and number exactly: A/94 and A/92. The control read A+/100 unchanged. Stack stayed at depth 1; rebuilt and re-ran both guards after the rewrite rather than assuming comments are inert.
obs THE PIN WAS 1,519 BYTES FREE AGAINST A ROW OF 2,500, so I folded the three CLOSED rows -- %450, %461, %462 -- whole to one shelf through reds_fold.sh rather than by hand, since the fourth step of a hand fold is re-anchoring links and that is the step forgotten twice. The shelf's header is a person's to write and the tool refuses without it, which is the right refusal. Pin 39,441 -> 30,961, then 34,467 with the row in.
obs THE CARD WAS 5 BYTES FREE, so my OWN census account folded whole to a dated shelf and the new account took its place -- 40,955 -> 40,883, 77 free. I did not touch a peer's live paragraph. The %449 block still reads *Booked: a census of authored .rye nothing ever compiles*, which landed as %463 and is answered further here; leaving a peer's own sentence for their own hand is cheaper than a merge conflict over prose.
obs THE REPAIR MOVED A NUMBER, AND THE CONTROL WRITTEN TO SURVIVE THAT REDDENED ANYWAY. With diff.rye compiled the census reads asserted=0, so its ceiling fell 1 -> 0 -- and rye_compile_reach_control.sh failed one phase of 53. That phase plants exactly one accused file and spelled `exit 0`, which was right only while the ceiling stood at 1; every other phase derives from the live ceiling, and the control's own header promises it keeps passing the day the ceiling falls. I wrote that header last lap and broke the promise in one phase of the same file. Derived now: one accused file meets the live ceiling, exit 0 at or above 1 and exit 1 at 0. Both branches are known against observed behavior rather than argued -- the ceiling>=1 branch is what the spelled 0 asserted correctly for the whole preceding lap, and the ceiling=0 branch is what the scan did this hour. 53 pass, 0 fail. Named inside %464 rather than booked its own number, since it is the standing borrowed-number class (%341, %357, %360) and a number per sentence dilutes the ledger.
obs WHAT I DID NOT CLAIM. This closes the mantra room and nothing wider. The census answers the GRAPH question -- 1,535 files reached by a build root or an import -- and lazy analysis means reached is not analyzed. How many of those the compiler actually checks is unmeasured, and I booked that rather than estimating it.

recommend keep-going -- the booked remainder is the natural next lap in this lane and it is measured rather than guessed: 1,535 files are reached by a build and an unknown number of them are actually analyzed, so the walker generalizes from one room to a census. It wants a module-room roster rather than a tree walk, since a walker must live beside what it walks. What stays Keaton's: %460's qemu sentence, the Mantra identity gap at the Line seam, and glow/rune_shape.rye width custody.
