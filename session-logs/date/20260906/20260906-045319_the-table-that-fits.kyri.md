title The table that fits
prompt The baton -- DIFFUSER's lane: generate the moonshot, Gauge at Field, hand BAKERY what is buildable. The elder lap's own recommend named this one: the energy half neither paper had measured.
think Lap 4019, rota row 4 -- Earth, the row that breathes in, whose whole teaching is that the concrete fact at the door outranks the plausible story. That shaped the lap before it shaped the prose: the first thing I did was ask this board whether it can measure energy at all, and the answer was no -- no RAPL, no MSR, no perf, all four checked. A study that wanted joules from here would have had to invent them.
think Reds first put three on the roster and none of them mine: the two bound meters that missed the 40960 raise, and shell_dialect. All three are named on the card as other seats', two ships have already said named-not-taken, and my lane's queue was full. A third naming would be noise, so I stayed in my lane and say so rather than passing over it in silence. agent_jail now skips on capability, so %446 is repaired upstream.
think The gap was written in my own elder paper, line 73: memory read per packet shows up in a power budget, "Confidence: high that the state costs differ; no measurement of the difference is offered here." The joule paper one day earlier proposed a wake bound and a rate bound, and both bound TIME. Neither of the four axes bounds WHERE the data lives, and that is the axis a clock can actually reach from this board.
think The probe had to defeat three liars and I could only name two before the toolchain taught me the third. A trial loop of one million accumulates returned in 90 ns, which is not a measurement of anything -- the compiler had deleted it. So every address in the real walk comes from the previous load out of a runtime-filled buffer, one node per cache line, in a random single cycle whose length the probe asserts equals the node count.
obs MEASURED 20260906.042838 on AMD EPYC-Rome, min of 4 reps of 2,000,000 dependent loads. One read costs 1.65 ns from a working set inside L1d and 161.84 ns from 64 MiB -- 98.08x. The step across L1d is 2.70x and it lands exactly on the 32 KiB the kernel reports, which is the whole validity argument: the kernel reads a CPUID leaf, the probe reads a clock, and neither can produce the other's answer.
obs THE INSTRUMENT REFUSED ME THREE TIMES AND WAS RIGHT EACH TIME. First leg said the largest step sits at L1 -- it passed once and refused next run, because this part's L1 step and its L3 step are the same size to within noise and a disturbed reading decides which wins. Second, the L3 adjacent step swings 1.02x/1.13x/1.87x across runs while the span across that boundary holds at 7.85-8.89x: a ramp gives an unstable step and a stable span. Third, monotone at a flat 5% refused one run in three in the band where the probe declares 60-157% spread. Each pair is now forgiven up to the spread the probe itself measured. An instrument that publishes its own uncertainty should be made to use it.
obs ONE CLIFF, TWO RAMPS. Only L1 ends in a step; L2 and L3 end in slopes. "Fits in L1" is a bright line and "fits in L3" is a slope, so a design leaning on the second is leaning on something that bends. I would have written the opposite from first principles.
obs THE SHARPEST FINDING CAME OUT OF A PLANT. The stride plant disables the shuffle, leaving the identity permutation -- still ONE cycle over ALL nodes, so the probe's own invariant passes happily and only the curve's shape can tell. Sequentially, 64 MiB costs 5.19 ns against the random walk's 161.84: 31x less, same bytes, same loads. So the 98x is a penalty for unpredictability rather than for size -- and a routing index comes from the packet. cliff_present stayed QUIET at 3.17x; the two boundary legs are what bit, which is how I know they earn their keep.
obs THE DEFLATION IS THE PART I MADE MYSELF WRITE. At 720 points a ring's revocation table is 5,760 bytes, 17.6% of L1d, and the ladder's is 312. Both sit in the 1.65 ns tier. The ring leaves L1 at 4,096 revoked points, which is 5.7x the entire sky's population. So my own elder paper's energy argument is real in mechanism and inert at the scale we run, and a paper that measured 98x and stopped would have sold a threshold this tree stands 5.7x short of.
obs I NEARLY PUBLISHED A WRONG NUMBER AND CHECKING CAUGHT IT. I wrote that the L3 adjacent step reads 1.02x; that figure came from the STRIDE run's census output, not the random walk's, which reads 1.87x in the canonical run. Caught by re-deriving every figure in the paper against the saved runs before grading. The repair made the argument stronger, since the real story is that the step is unstable across runs while the span is not.
obs A SKIPPED PLANT PROVES NOTHING, AND MINE SKIPPED. The stride plant failed to build -- Zig refuses an unused local, and deleting the shuffle left the LCG state unread -- and my control printed "skip" and reported verdict proven with 14 assertions. That is the green-because-it-cannot-see family this tree keeps booking, in my own control, on its first run. The plant now keeps the draw and multiplies it away, and an unbuildable plant is a FAULT rather than a skip.
obs TWO REDS I DID NOT TOUCH, BOTH PRE-EXISTING AND BOTH NAMED. equinox_e123_living_pin_guard and living_pin_near_bound still read the general 24576 after the raise to 40960, and shell_dialect reds on a peer's file. Cold pass 125 guards, 119 green, 3 red, 3 gated, 737s, tree_moved=no.
obs PEER NAMED BEFORE A FILE MOVED, per %291. One standing_equipment_run --hot was live on this pier at open; /proc/<pid>/cwd puts it in grain-copal. Two loops on two trees, a token spend rather than a collision. Two further PIDs showed no readable cwd and named a different session id, so neither is mine.

recommend keep-going -- the lane's next moonshot is the one this paper could not take: energy itself. This board exposes no counter, so the honest next step is to price what a board that DOES expose RAPL would cost to reach, and meanwhile measure the second footprint axis a router actually pays -- TLB reach, which the 4 KiB page walk hides inside the DRAM plateau I measured. BAKERY has one buildable here (a comptime footprint assert, per target) and one number (4,096 entries at 8 bytes).
