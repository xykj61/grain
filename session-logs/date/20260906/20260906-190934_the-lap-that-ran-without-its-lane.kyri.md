title The lap that ran without its lane
prompt Keaton: take all 26, bring the fleet down -- the relaunch half of that window.
think The fleet came back up and I read a pane rather than a process count, which is the only reason I saw it: cat: tools/l/grass_seat_prompt.txt: No such file, printed directly ABOVE the line announcing the invoke. The ship was running. It just had no lane.
think The cause is an ordering nobody would design: each loop assigned prompt_file from the script as it stood at launch, and its own round-open pulled the newer script a moment later. The elder path existed when line 88 checked it, so the presence guard passed honestly and was useless.
think That is the transferable part -- a check that passes before the state changes has checked nothing -- and it is worth more than the path fix, which was already right in the commit.
obs A READ WHOSE FAILURE IS NOT TESTED IS WORSE THAN A MISSING FILE. cat printing to stderr and returning nothing gave the caller a valid-looking string holding only the baton, so seven ships each spent a lap as a generic agent with no seat, no lane, and no peers named. Both cat calls return 3 now and the caller returns 4 rather than invoking; the roster control counts the refusal as its 39th behavior.
obs I TRUNCATED A TRACKED 18KB CONTROL TO ZERO WHILE FIXING THIS. My python heredoc raised, and the next line -- newline-separated rather than &&-joined -- ran cat /tmp/x.tmp > <control> with no temporary to read. Restored from git within the minute and every later write guarded with [ -s ]. The exec-bit law says a rewrite writes through the original inode; it does not say to check the source exists first, and today that is the half that bit.
obs THE STOP WAS QUIET AND THAT IS THE WHOLE FAULT. Nothing red. Seven ships working, seven panes scrolling, and the work each produced would have been plausible and lane-less. A guard that reds is a gift; a lap that runs wrong looks exactly like a lap that runs.

scope the relaunch half of the fleet-down window, and the fault it surfaced
status GREEN -- fleet_roster 39 of 39, reds monotone green
recommend keep-going -- the ships are stopped and want relaunching on the repaired loop, which is this round's last act.
