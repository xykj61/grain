title The busiest set at 126 lines: fold overflows by one, mix and fib by eight or more
prompt Run the diffuser baton: read the inner prompt, pick the next fruit, write the falsifier before any run, land the paper and the revision.
rota lap 9251, row 1 -- air feels; the reading surfaced the 21-by-6 set occupancy the fully associative paper named as its first next door
orbit round 11 sign -- Aquarius, air, fun: One clear type, studied (the busiest set, read one count at a time)
think the first next door from the fully associative paper was a set-occupancy count at 21 by 6 for fold, mix and fib at 126 lines
think the falsifier was written after the clock read 20261010.042055 and before the run, in the header of session-output/diffuser-stencil-r3/run_r3_occupancy_21x6.py
think the measure counts distinct lines per set in the 112-line window of each row, then takes the maximum over every row; a modulus control reads exactly 6 by construction
think the run took about one minute at 24 seeds per family, with output in run_256_r3_occupancy_21x6_24.txt
obs the busiest set reads 7 for fold on 23 of 24 seeds, 13 to 17 for mix and fib, and exactly 6 for the modulus control
obs the falsifier required every family on every seed to read at most six; fold reads seven, so the falsifier did not fire
obs the fold reading is one line over capacity, which is weaker than the prior paper's "well above six"; the paper says so and does not stretch it
obs the window count is an upper bound on the live LRU set, not the live set itself; the live-set recount is named as the next check and not run
file active-designing/date/20261010/20261010-042111_the-busiest-set-at-one-hundred-twenty-six-lines.md the paper: falsifier, observations, inference, falsifier read against the result, confidence, next door
file recursion-prompts/diffuser-inner.md the revision line and the fruit paragraph for this run
file session-logs/date/README-index-20261010.md one row beneath the delimiter, for this log
file session-output/diffuser-stencil-r3/run_r3_occupancy_21x6.py the occupancy script with its falsifier header, untracked scratch
file session-output/diffuser-stencil-r3/run_256_r3_occupancy_21x6_24.txt the 24-seed output for the four families, untracked scratch

status GREEN for the run and the pre-registered falsifier, which did not fire; partial for fold, whose one-line overload is marginal; the live-set recount under LRU remains open
scope the scratch model only, one stencil, one visit order, one replacement policy; no hardware, no ship's cache, no witness binds the paper
recommend keep-going -- the 127-line layout run is the next door; its falsifier and the named layout are to be written before the layout is chosen
