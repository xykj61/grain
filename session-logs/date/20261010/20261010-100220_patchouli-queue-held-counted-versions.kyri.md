title Patchouli, queue held at counted record versions
prompt Patchouli baton: read the inner prompt, find the next fruit in mantra/ or tally/, or say the queue is empty.
think read recursion-prompts/patchouli-inner.md: the lane's own protocol says the queue reads empty when the chronological-header scan finds nothing.
think fresh net one: quoted version literals in mantra/ and tally/ are already chronological stamps (for example beading_version, batch_version, witness_version); no counted literal remains there.
think fresh net two: the counted literals that remain are mantra-weave-v1/v2 and mantra-commit-v1/v2 on-disk record headers; main.rye still writes mantra-weave-v2 and mantra-commit-v2, so changing them moves a compatibility contract.
think the fixture signatures named fixture-signature-v1 and v2 are test data, not record versions, and they are left alone.
obs a record header is a wire or on-disk contract; rye-versioning-style.md says elder headers keep their names forever, so moving the writer is Keaton's word, not a lap's.
obs no code changed this lap; the only edit is this log, its shelf row, and the card's git nib, which is the rule for a log-only follow-up.
file recursion-prompts/patchouli-inner.md why the lane's queue rule was read at lap open
file mantra/src/main.rye why it holds the counted headers that the writer still emits
file session-logs/date/README-index-20261010.md why the shelf row was added under the delimiter
rota none -- queue-empty lap; the inner prompt's own empty-queue protocol governed this pass
loom witness=none wall_ms=0 -- no measurement taken this lap
product_nib none -- no product change this lap
suite_nib none -- no suite change this lap
git_nib ca2c196b7e -- HEAD read before this log commit, carried into construction/ITINERARY.md
scope read-only net over mantra/ and tally/, one log and one shelf row
status GREEN -- no witness run because no code moved; the queue is held at the counted-header question, which needs Keaton's word
recommend check-in (Claude) -- the next fruit is a compatibility decision: whether mantra-weave-v2 and mantra-commit-v2 molt to chronological headers, or whether the counted headers stay as the on-disk contract
