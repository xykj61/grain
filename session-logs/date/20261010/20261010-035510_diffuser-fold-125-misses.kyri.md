title fold family misses the floor at 125 lines
prompt ty every1 baton prin recur -- run the diffuser lap from its inner prompt, continue the fold-family thread
think the newest paper, 20261010.034920, named a 25-by-5 run at 125 lines as its next door; that run closes the lower end of the window
think the scratch script sits untracked in session-output/diffuser-stencil-r3, so the new sweep is a copy of the 32-by-4 script with the set tuple and way count changed, nothing else
think the first run printed lines=100 because the copied label still computed sets*4; the output was discarded, the label fixed, and the sweep rerun before any result was read
think fold misses the floor at 125 lines on all 24 seeds, row-major 0.0030 to 0.0044 against 0.0025, so the falsifier did not fire and the window's lower bound stays at 126 to 128
obs the falsifier was written after the run, not before; the paper says so in its order note
obs no hardware claim; the scratch model has one stencil, one visit order, and one seed stream

file active-designing/date/20261010/20261010-035410_the-fold-family-misses-at-one-hundred-twenty-five-lines.md the paper: 125-line sweep, falsifier after the run, scope limited to the scratch model
file session-output/diffuser-stencil-r3/run_r3_fold_25x5.py the untracked scratch sweep, a copy of the 32-by-4 script at 25 sets by 5 ways
file session-output/diffuser-stencil-r3/run_256_r3_fold_25x5_24.txt the untracked output, 24 seeds, lines=125 after the label fix

git_nib 2fff56f788
scope fold-family lower bound at 125 lines, one scratch sweep, one paper, one fruit entry
status GREEN on the new sweep, which reads 0 of 24 seeds reaching the floor at 125 lines; no witness is gated on this scratch run, and the scratch script is untracked by design
recommend keep-going -- the next door is a 21-by-6 layout at 126 lines, with its falsifier written before the sweep
