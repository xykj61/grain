title diffuser lap: fold misses the floor at 124 lines, threshold sits between 125 and 128
prompt baton and inner prompt read; take the next door the seventeen-and-eighteen-set paper named
think the card's next door was a 31-sets-by-4-ways run at 124 lines, a line count between the measured 120 (miss) and 128 (reach)
think the scratch sweep script was present in the gitignored session-output room; copied with only the set list and way count changed
think falsifier named before the run: if fold reached the floor at 124 on any seed, the threshold would sit at or below 124
obs fold misses the floor on all 24 seeds at 124 lines, row-major 0.0036 to 0.0038 against the 0.0025 floor; the capacity reading predicted this and the falsifier did not fire
obs the threshold now sits in the window 125 to 128 lines on this model; the scratch model is one stencil and one seed stream, so no hardware claim follows
obs an unverified sentence in the first draft about the modulus control's index arithmetic was struck before commit; the paper states only what this run measured
rota lap 9200, row 0 -- aether hears; the reading surfaced a clean falsifier branch and a small window, not a new law

status GREEN for the sweep and the paper's own arithmetic; the paper and inner prompt landed in this commit; the scratch script and output stay in the gitignored room
scope active-designing paper, recursion-prompts inner prompt, session-logs day shelf
recommend kg -- the next door is a 32-by-4 run at 128 lines, which tests whether the way count moves the 128 point; the falsifier is named in the paper
