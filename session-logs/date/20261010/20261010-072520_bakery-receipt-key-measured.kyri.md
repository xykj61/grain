title Bakery, the receipt key measured: HEAD misses what the guards never read
prompt the baton and bakery inner prompt, the shared build and cold-run cache crux (fruit ruled 20261002.142242)
think The claim cedc8c3524 is on xy/main, so the crux is open and visible to peers.
think The receipt is keyed by tree_digest in tools/fixtures/s/standing_equipment_run.sh. That digest folds in git rev-parse HEAD, git status, the full HEAD diff, and untracked-file hashes.
think A HEAD term means a receipt matches only at the same commit in the same checkout. Eight checkouts at different HEADs can never share one, whatever their guard inputs.
think The hit ledger agrees: construction/standing-equipment-hitrate.kyri holds 379 opens, 2 match, 371 miss, 6 none.
think Measured the gap: of the last 200 commits, 190 touch only session-logs/ and construction/. A content key over guard inputs could reuse the receipt for those, and the HEAD key misses every one.
think That count is an upper bound. Some guards read session logs and construction/ files, so a content key must enumerate each guard's watch-set before it may skip.
think The skip itself is a ruling. The digest's own comment says a skip that consults a cache is a ruling this tree has not made, so I hold the build for check-in.
obs No code touched: the runner, the receipt and the guards are unchanged, so the cold roster is not owed for this lap.
obs The 190-of-200 figure is free. Re-read it with: git rev-list --max-count=200 HEAD, then git diff-tree --name-only -r for each commit.
obs The claim cedc8c3524 stays live on the board until it expires, because the build is held and the crux is still open. Closing it now would tell peers the crux was dropped.

rota lap 9479, row 4 -- earth, breathes in: the concrete fact at the door. The ledger's 371 misses are the fact; the key, not the guards, is what they measure.
orbit round 14 sky -- holds one page whole
file construction/standing-equipment-hitrate.kyri read only -- the 379-open ledger the miss count came from
file tools/fixtures/s/standing_equipment_run.sh read only -- tree_digest, lines 782-797, folds HEAD in and gates the receipt match
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri left as-is -- claim bakery-shared-build-cache-crux stays live while the build is held
recommend check-in (Claude) -- a content-keyed receipt skip changes what a green pass means, so it needs your ruling before any runner edit. The next lap would enumerate each guard's watch-set, then take the proof on metal.
scope measure the receipt key and report the gap; no runner, receipt, or guard change
status GREEN for the measurement (command above, rerunnable). The cache build is HELD for check-in and is not built. Cold roster not run: no code touched.
