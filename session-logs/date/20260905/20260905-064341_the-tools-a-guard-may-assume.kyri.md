title The tools a guard may assume
prompt both took, they're running -- take the utility yonder now
think Started with measurement rather than reading, because the outside view is only worth anything against a number. The first count was wrong and visibly so: test at 4,658 and env at 1,735 are prose words inside comments, not invocations. The second pass took command position only -- line start or after a pipe, semicolon, and-and, dollar-paren, backtick, then, do, else, brace -- with full-line comments stripped. 52 distinct utilities across 2,969 tool scripts.
think Two readings carry the study. rg is invoked 992 times and probed once; it is not POSIX and ships on no system by default. mktemp is invoked 353 times and probed zero times, and its specification was removed at POSIX.1-2008. Both are green here only because this pier happens to carry them.
obs I nearly wrote that readlink is non-POSIX and checked instead. It is POSIX, as are realpath, timeout, xargs and iconv -- the non-portable part of readlink -f is the FLAG, which shell_dialect already gates. Asserting from memory would have retired four portable tools for no reason, and the correction is recorded in the study itself rather than quietly fixed.
obs The finding that reframed the whole design: the tree already wrote the cure. shell_portable.sh publishes eleven helpers over exactly the seams that differ, and 38 of 2,969 scripts source it -- 1.3 percent. That is not the helper being wrong, it is the ordinary fate of a library published into code already written, and it is why the design puts a ratchet before a helper rather than after it.
obs Also corrected a reading of our own card. It says two guards were rg on a pier that ships none; rg IS on this pier, ripgrep-15.1.0, so that note was about another bench. Checking before repeating it kept a false claim out of the study.
think The outside view came from two harnesses and they answer the same question two ways. DeepSeek Harness declares dependencies in a manifest -- environment constraints and plugin dependencies in YAML or JSON -- and its Minimal mode restricts execution to a persistent shell session and text-editing utilities, which is literally this study's question answered by configuration. Claude Code hoists Read, Edit, Write and Grep out of the shell into typed tools, so an agent that reads with Read depends on no cat. Observed directly from a jailed lap's own init event rather than quoted from documentation.
obs The silo held. external-research names DeepSeek and Claude Code with attribution and sources; active-designing/yonder names only Tally, Caravan, Mantra, Aurora, Rye, Rishi and Glow. Concepts crossed the boundary, no code did.
obs The design is three tiers -- granted, carried, borrowed -- and the tier says what happens on absence. Its first movement is a roster rather than a meter, deliberately: a meter that counts against no roster is a meter with an opinion, and this tree has learned twice this week what an unrostered reading is worth.
obs One sentence in it should not wait for the rest: a guard that cannot run its instrument refuses, and says which instrument. Three lines wherever a scan reaches for something it did not write, and this tree paid for it twice in a day.

recommend check-in (Keaton) -- the pair is filed in yonder and builds nothing; the one reflex worth taking now is the refusal sentence, which fits in any lap that touches a scan
