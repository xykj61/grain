host NixOS pier, ai-jail enclosure, America/New_York
title eight cores, eight seats
prompt the pier upgraded to 8 vCPU and 16 GB; new commands for all eight ships
think Verified the pier rather than taking the order confirmation: 8 cores, 15,988 MB, steal 0.007 percent over the new uptime. The load math that mattered all day now reads eight ships at roughly 1.9 concurrent rosters on eight cores.
think Checked what the deleted authorized_keys actually broke. It is inbound SSH to the pier, and the ships push outbound on their own per-tree deploy keys, which survived -- git ls-remote answers and every key file stands. Two different key systems, and only one was touched.
think Found the disk half claimed: vda is 350G and vda3 is 179.5G, so about 170 GB sits unallocated after the resize. Worth a hand before five births copy 445 MB of toolchain each.
obs Flipping the five berthed seats to live earned them stagger slots -- the loop reads its offset from the LIVE roster, so a berthed ship takes slot 1 beside incense and never staggers, which is the one shape the offset exists to prevent.
obs The flip reddened the roster control, and the control was right to notice and wrong in how. Three legs named bakery as their berthed example and asserted against the real roster, so a lawful promotion broke them. They plant their own two-seat roster in a pen now, and a fourth leg asserts the live seat IS listed, so the exclusion is proven rather than read from an empty answer.
obs The pen needed its construction marker as well as FLEET_ROSTER, because the scan walks up for a tree root before it reads the override.

recommend check-in Keaton -- five births then eight launches; the unallocated 170 GB wants a hand first
