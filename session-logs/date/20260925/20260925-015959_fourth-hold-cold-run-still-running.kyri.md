model claude-sonnet-5
model_status configured fleet default per .claude/settings.json, resolved value unverified this lap
voice Kyri
title round-open clean, claim board still clear, the same cold run still in flight
prompt Baton-driven lap open with no new user prompt; live inside recursion-prompts/incense-inner.md
think Read incense-inner.md and the baton whole; the rite's step 3 asks HEAD be read once then the cold run launched and held to.
think Ran round-open; open on 0f818a5cad, twelve dead-letter stash entries reported, none new since the prior lap's reading.
think Checked for a standing run before starting one: pid 4053442 (sh tools/fixtures/s/standing_equipment_run.sh --cadence-slice 1), cwd-confirmed this tree via /proc, still alive at 794s elapsed -- the same pass three prior laps have held for, launched 01:46 on settled HEAD 27cbb5a098.
think Watched it advance twice across this lap -- 87 lines at the prior lap's reading, then 96, 103, 116 across four checks here, roughly 20-30s apart -- confirming forward progress rather than a hang before deciding to hold rather than launch a second pass.
think Read construction/fleet-claims.kyri: seven live claims, none naming a path in this seat's law/active-designing/REDS lane.
think Re-ran reds_pin_capacity_scan.sh: identical to the last three readings -- pin_deadlocked=1, pin_headroom=10, the same five unheld rows (%827 %808 %803 %785 %730).
think Re-read construction/ITINERARY.md's Open doors for Keaton section whole: unchanged since the prior lap, still waiting on Keaton's word on a %338 door or one of the five rows closing.
obs Found one small inconsistency while reading the prior log for context, noted rather than acted on: session-logs/date/20260925/20260925-023135_third-hold-cold-run-still-running.kyri carries stamp 20260925.023135, yet its own commit 0f818a5cad landed at author/committer time 2026-09-25 01:56:47 -0400 -- the stamp reads later than the commit that carries it. Likely a clock-read slip in the prior lap rather than anything load-bearing; no REDS row opened for it here, both because the ledger sits at pin_headroom=10 with no lawful fold available and because tracked bytes must stay untouched while this tree's own cold run is in flight.
obs Holding a fourth time in a row is the honest answer rather than a stall: the pass is past a third of its roughly 370-plus guard lines, still advancing, and launching a second pass at the same settled tree would spend exactly what the ORDER clause exists to protect for no new information.
obs Nothing in this seat's lane has agent-doable work outstanding that is not already named on the card (the pin-fold deadlock, Keaton's word) or claimed by another lane.
file construction/ITINERARY.md why-one-line: read whole per the baton; no edit this pass, Open doors bullet still current.
file recursion-prompts/incense-inner.md why-one-line: read whole per the baton; no edit this pass, state and next sections still current.
status GREEN -- no repair opened, nothing this lap's own to fix; holding is the correct action given the in-flight pass and the pin-fold deadlock awaiting Keaton's word.
scope this lap only: round-open, claim-board read, cold-run progress check, log.
recommend keep-going -- wait for this tree's own in-flight cold run to close, then review its reds against the known backlog and either close a fresh in-lane finding or log a clean continuation.
