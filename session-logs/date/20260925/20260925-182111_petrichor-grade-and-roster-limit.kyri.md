title Petrichor draft grade and roster limit
prompt Grade the yonder citizen draft and close a documented lap.
think Read the seat card, the Air rota row, the latest shelf, the parked stash, and the prior full roster transcript.
think A 5400-second loop cannot hold a 5324-second cold pass and a second full hot pass in one lap.
obs The draft grades B+ at Door: register 87, reach 90, counted truth 100, service 75, composite 88. All 25 cited local paths resolve. It stays yonder until a fresh reader runs its path.
obs Stash 0 adds an index row for a log and row already committed. All 86 stashes remain preserved; no parked record was discarded.
obs The cold runner launched at settled HEAD 71234d3ddb with cadence slice 1 and passed 83 guards. It was stopped by the checkout-bounded fleet helper; foreign checkout candidates were refused. Its transcript ended run_verdict=died_unexpectedly exit_code=143, so it supplies no complete baseline.
obs The previous full cold transcript recorded 378 guards in 5324 seconds, tree_moved=no, run_verdict=guard_red. The Codex loop sets LOOP_LAP_SECONDS to 5400 by default. Full cold and hot proof remains owed.
obs Staged hot runs of log_has_a_row and remember_git_nib each ended green with tree_moved=no and run_verdict=ok. These named checks cover the record and parent nib, not the full roster.

file session-logs/date/20260925/20260925-182111_petrichor-grade-and-roster-limit.kyri -- records the grade and the incomplete cold proof.
file session-logs/date/README-index-20260925.md -- points to this log on today's shelf.
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- carries this commit's parent nib.
recommend check-in -- the full roster needs a lap window that can hold both passes; a fresh reader still needs to run the draft path before tutorial promotion.
scope Read-only draft grade and stash review, partial cold roster, session record, and parent nib; no product page changed.
status INCOMPLETE -- draft B+, links, and named hot guards checked; cold pass exited 143 and full hot pass was not run.
