title Review parked enclosure checks against the roster split
prompt Recover unfinished Bakery work before new work; preserve stashes and commit and push the lap record.
obs Round-open settled at f10779e2e8 with a clean tree and index. All 85 stashes remain preserved. The bounded stash scan reports 1224 orphan paths and 1073 work paths; its known truncation prevents a full-coverage claim.
obs Read the seat prompt, operator card, handoffs, newest three shelf entries and newest recommendation. The newest local Bakery transcript is historical; current decisions use the dated shelf records and current source.
obs Claim check fetched xy and returned commits_behind=0 and overlap_peer=0. Diffuser holds sleep timing, Copal bounds recovery, and Patchouli flat-log counting. This record review opens no instrument or booked repair.

obs The four drafts add an inline mount-namespace skip and its probe/control. Commit e18370388 instead split base and enclosure witnesses, with the enclosure row using the roster's jail_nesting capability. Today's base witness passes. Keep the split; restoring the saved witness would collapse two separately reported promises.
obs The path-absence scan fetched xy and confirmed the draft probe and control absent both locally and upstream, with commits_behind=0. They are preserved in stash f3c9af74dfb4; path absence alone is not a restoration instruction.
obs Compared extracted current capability_state with the saved mount_namespace_state using four controlled bwrap states. Both return present on success, absent on the known permission refusal, and unknown when bwrap is missing. On an unsupported-option failure, the saved probe returns unknown while current returns absent. Current source explicitly documents this remaining limitation and its control expects the skip.
obs Preserve the draft's stricter error classification as a candidate for a separate repair with broader refusal controls. The draft is not a drop-in replacement: it uses a different payload, recognizes one refusal spelling, and its witness/control expect the old single-witness structure. This review changes no runtime source and proves no real enclosure launch.

rota lap 6602, row 2 -- Fire - Mars; read the threshold and three seats. Keep the working roster split and preserve the draft's useful refusal distinction; a newer implementation is not proof that every older behavior was superseded.
obs Full cold, cadence, and hot proof remain owed. The prior paired-pass estimate exceeds the recorded lap window. This record-only review claims neither a full-roster verdict nor mapped independence.
obs The send fetch found xy unchanged and rebase reported up to date. Lap-open HEAD and pre-fetch xy/main remain in session-output for the moved-proof reading.
obs The current standing-equipment control completed with all 14 jail-specific checks reporting yes. Comparing its output to 359 literal assertions in the Rishi witness leaves eight unmet assertions, all in lost-answer/unrun handling. The control's exit zero and control_verdict=ok alone do not prove that suite; no whole-control GREEN is claimed.

obs Focused index-row-bound and parent-nib witnesses pass, including their refusal controls.
obs Touched records grade A+: inner prompt 98, log 100, shelf 100, card 100. Path truth was counted; changed recovery claims and the sole card nib were checked against this lap's evidence.
recommend keep-going -- review the remaining twelve roster source versions, retain every stash, and carry the named test repairs and full-roster debt forward.
file recursion-prompts/bakery-inner.md -- carry the four-version enclosure review and its remaining limitation.
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- carry the next commit parent nib.
file session-logs/date/README-index-20260925.md -- prepend one shelf-qualified record row.
scope Four parked enclosure-test versions reviewed; production source unchanged.
status INCOMPLETE -- base witness passes; twelve source versions, named repairs, real enclosure proof, and full roster proof remain owed.
