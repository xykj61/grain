title Bakery cold proof and lap window
prompt Recover parked work, honor the held cold pass, and close the lap with a log and commit.
obs Updated the operator card and Bakery prompt to record incomplete verification and the measured lap-window constraint. Shelved the prior account whole with its link adjusted for the archive directory.
obs Round-open held HEAD at 24de55b4d5. The claim scan fetched xy, read board=upstream and commits_behind=0, and found no peer overlap. This lap opened no new instrument or booked repair.
obs Preserved all 85 stashes. Both recent parked session logs are already committed. The build-target scan and control match the parked repair; wrap-ring holds the newer private-directory cleanup.
obs The newest stash contains 1196 tpr source copies. A bounded Git-tree comparison found 1180 matching HEAD blobs, four matching source at the stash base, and twelve symlink-source copies; reading current source bytes brings current matches to 1192. No parked bytes were discarded.
obs Launched the full cold roster with cadence-slice 1 at 20260925.094123. The returned transcript is session-output/standing-equipment-cold.txt and the recorded runner PID was 3159664. HEAD and tracked files stayed unchanged until the runner exited.
obs The active ancestor timeout is 5400 seconds. At 68 minutes 11 seconds into the lap, unfinished lap guards had cost 627 seconds in the previous hot pass; selected cadence guard qa_genre_census had cost 873 seconds in its last run. The combined 1500 seconds exceeded the remaining 1309 seconds before any close or send work.
obs Sent TERM only to recorded PID 3159664 through fleet_call. The helper verified this checkout and reported one signal sent. The runner exited before any tracked edit and printed run_verdict=died_unexpectedly exit_code=143. The interruption was deliberate, not evidence of disk failure.
obs The transcript contains 310 completed guards. All completed verdicts match their counterparts in the previous full hot pass. No final tree digest or full-roster verdict was emitted; no tree_moved=no claim is made.

obs Stash-record, ryekey, rye_build, TAME style, generated-page freshness, and nib checks passed within the partial transcript. The full cold close, cadence guard, integrated hot pass, and 25 observed reds remain open.
obs Proposed per-guard reuse for unchanged complete input closures on the card, while retaining failed, unknown, and history-sensitive checks. The existing full-green receipt requirement stays in force. The 10800-second lap-window question remains Keaton's.
obs All six touched records grade A+; the inner prompt was graded at its declared Field setting. QA control passed 184 behaviors, account-shelf control passed 43, and index-row and parent-nib witnesses passed. These targeted checks are not a full hot roster.
obs The first commit message was refused because its body carried one counted mechanism term where three were required. The corrected body names the log file, status field, and archive directory; hooks remain enabled.
obs The send fetch advanced xy/main from 24de55b4d5 to 0f8b8b231 through three commits and twelve paths. The moved-proof tool reports nine shared proofs, proof_scope=full, and proof_reason=proof_overlap. The rebase conflict was the parent hash alone; peer accounts and shelf rows were preserved. Full verification of this later integrated tree remains owed.

rota lap 6561, row 1 -- Air - Saturn; distinguish a guard's valid result from the whole roster's verdict, and keep the time boundary explicit before another pass is launched.
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- name the incomplete pass, preserve the lap-window question, and propose the receipt boundary.
file construction/CHECKPOINTS.md -- preserve the walk-back before shelving Bakery's previous account.
file construction/archive/20260925-105055_bakery-held-roster-account.md -- preserve the complete prior account.
file recursion-prompts/bakery-inner.md -- carry the verified recovery and incomplete proof to the next lap.
file session-logs/date/20260925/20260925-105055_bakery-cold-window.kyri -- record this lap's measured scope and deliberate stop.
file session-logs/date/README-index-20260925.md -- add one shelf-qualified row.
recommend check-in -- the cold run's remaining measured cost exceeded the active lap window; reserve enough time before another full cold/hot pair. Recovery is accounted for and preserved.
scope Recovery audit, partial cold verification of 24de55b4d5, and a bounded proof-budget handoff. No implementation changed.
status INCOMPLETE -- 310 guards completed; full cold, cadence, and full hot remain owed. The recorded runner has exited; no pass is left for the next lap to invalidate.
