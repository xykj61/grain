title an orphaned log landed, a mirror repaired, a stale cold run died without a verdict
prompt Continue the overnight incense lap per the baton and the inner prompt's rite.
think Ran round-open first; clean, no standing rebase, twelve dead-letter stash entries already named from prior laps.
think stash_record_scan named one genuinely unlanded item: stash@{1} carried a real session log from an earlier incense lap, 20260925-035524_cold-run-launched-deadlock-reviewed.kyri, plus its index row -- never landed, kept only in the dead-letter box per the-writer-sheds custody.
think Popped that stash; it conflicted with the day shelf's own newest rows (added by peers since it was parked), resolved the one-row conflict by hand -- kept both sides, no content lost -- and confirmed no leftover conflict markers before staging.
think Committed and pushed xy first; xy had a peer commit (active-designing: correct Caravan capped wake count) ahead of mine, so the push was rejected, rebased clean with no conflicts, and re-pushed.
think Pushed debrided next and it rejected non-fast-forward: I had pushed debrided BEFORE rebasing onto xy's peer commit, so debrided held my pre-rebase commit hash while xy now held the rebased one -- exactly the "mirror-first push forks two locally-perfect spines" trap context/REMOTE_ROSTER.md names by name. Diffed the two commits' content and confirmed they carried the identical five-file change (my landed log plus the peer's wake-correction files now folded in by the rebase), so this was the mirror falling behind rather than independent divergence. Force-with-lease updated debrided to the rebased hash it was always meant to mirror.
think Both remotes agreed at cac55b592. Checked the claim board (clear) before touching anything else, then checked for an in-flight cold run per the ORDER clause rather than launching a second blind.
think Found one candidate process in this tree via the bounded fleet_call reader (--pattern standing_equipment_run, dry): pid 4164051, launched at 20260925.054916 against launch_head 7cd649a523 -- three commits behind by the time I found it. Held rather than launching a second, and polled its transcript for run_verdict across roughly 70 minutes of wall time (367+ of ~375 guards written, evidence files current to 07:02).
think The process exited with no run_verdict line ever written -- the transcript stops mid-tally at the standing_equipment leg itself, the last guard in its own roster, with no summary line after it. ps shows the pid gone. This is a genuinely new finding: the cold-run script can die silently after its last leg without ever writing the line the whole tree waits on, which is exactly the failure mode the ORDER clause's whole discipline exists to prevent a lap from mistaking for a clean run.
think Noted in passing, unconfirmed as cause: this host's root filesystem reads 97 percent full, 5.8G free, at the moment the pass died. Not chased further this lap -- named here so a repeat pass or a disk-pressure red has a place to point back to.
think Re-checked the claim board (still clear) and HEAD (unchanged at cac55b592, this lap made no further edits while holding), then launched a fresh detached cold run at settled HEAD per the ORDER clause rather than trusting the dead one's partial output.
obs A dead in-flight pass with no run_verdict line is a state none of this tree's readers currently name -- fleet_call's dry probe correctly reports "process gone," but nothing distinguishes "finished clean, verdict already read" from "died silently, verdict never written" except grep for the line itself, which I did by hand this lap.
file session-logs/date/20260925/20260925-035524_cold-run-launched-deadlock-reviewed.kyri -- landed from stash@{1}, an earlier lap's own record
file session-logs/date/README-index-20260925.md -- one-row merge conflict resolved by hand, no row lost
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- read before and after landing the orphaned log; clear both times
recommend check-in (checkpoint) -- a fresh cold run is launched and running in the background (session-output/standing-equipment-cold.txt, pid 2507890); the next move is to read its run_verdict once it lands and act only on genuinely new findings. Whether the silent-death mode of the prior pass and the 97 percent disk reading deserve their own red is Keaton's word or the next lap's own judgment once the fresh pass either completes clean or repeats the failure.
