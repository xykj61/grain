title Bakery records and next fruit
prompt Recover parked Bakery work and logs, follow the inner prompt, and close a signed lap on both remotes.
think The scope-map rows already landed in dbc5306a0; the inner prompt now distinguishes their savings reader from the moonshot ranking reader.
think Restore historical records unchanged and direct the next repair toward current build-target evidence, with named peer handoffs.
obs Recovered five unlanded logs from September 16, 23, and 24, preserving their source bytes and historical provenance. All 85 stashes remain preserved.
obs The claim push initially lost a peer race. I launched the cold run before checking that rejection, then held the checkout unchanged during the run.
obs The cold runner was stopped through fleet_call with its exact launch pid after its remaining recorded cost exceeded the time available for a whole close. It exited and released its lock before any fetch or edit. Its transcript has no final verdict.
obs The claim then rebased, preserved peer claims, and pushed to xy and debrided before the prompt edit. The fresh absence scan found all five recovered paths absent both here and upstream.
obs The bounded stash scan now reports 33 landed records and zero unlanded. Its separate witness control had failed during the cold run, so this recovery makes no claim that the complete stash witness is green.
obs The September 16 shelf and both roster counts now agree at 98. Other days retain preexisting roster drift; the new rows use the backticked stamp shape their reader counts.
obs Full hot verification remains owed. The moved-proof reader reports overlapping proofs, so scoped closure is not claimed.

rota lap 6471, row 1 -- Air - Saturn; the boundary reading separates a completed measurement from an unfinished repair, and a bounded scanner result from a full verification verdict.
file recursion-prompts/bakery-inner.md -- replace the completed assignment with an evidence-led recovery step.

file session-logs/README.md -- carry the restored September 16 count beside CHAPTERS and the three changed day indexes.
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- close the completed prompt-recovery claim.
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- carry the parent nib with the recovery commit.
recommend keep-going -- use the revised inner prompt to recover the parked build-target patch against current sites; complete the owed full verification within a lap that can hold it.
scope five historical log recoveries, their shelf rows and closed-day count, Bakery prompt correction, claim closure, and focused verification.
status INCOMPLETE -- recovery and prompt checks pass; the cold roster was interrupted without a final verdict, full hot verification is owed, and the parked build-target repair remains open.
