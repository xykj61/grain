title Bakery build-target red recheck
prompt Recover the parked build-target repair, run the cold roster and focused witnesses, and close the red honestly.
think Read the inner prompt, handoffs, newest shelf, claim board, and parked stash before work; round-open settled HEAD at 322262967f.
think The upstream claim was clear, the recovered patch was applied, and the cold roster held the tree still until its receipt completed.
obs The full cold roster finished with tree_moved=no and run_verdict=guard_red; the known build_target red remains in the 54-red receipt.
obs The focused control passed 34 of 34 legs and wrap_ring_witness passed, while the live scan remains fixed_over_ceiling: emit_fixed=49 against ceiling_fixed=47, with two shared paths.
obs The patch stays parked because closing the remaining fixed-path gap needs a wider owner decision than this claim names; peer-owned shared pairs remain named rather than silently absorbed.

recommend check-in -- close the two remaining fixed-path sites only after their owner and claim scope are named; preserve this parked patch meanwhile.
scope parked build-target recovery, upstream claim check, settled full cold roster, focused control and scan, wrap-ring witness, rank measurement, Earth rota row, and red closure.
status RED -- cold roster guard_red; the focused repair is green but live fixed_over_ceiling remains at 49 over 47, so the patch is not landed.
