title Bakery build-target red and parked repair
prompt Recover the parked Bakery build-target repair, prove it against the cold roster, and close honestly.
think Read the style, itinerary, inner prompt, handoffs, newest shelf, roster, claim board, and parked stashes before acting.
think Recovered the live bakery claim and its patch, then parked the patch during a clean full cold roster so the pass could hold HEAD still.
obs The cold roster completed at launch_head=3973554ef4 with 371 guards, 318 green, 50 red, 3 gated, tree_moved=no, run_verdict=guard_red; build_target was red.
obs The focused build-target control passed 34 of 34 legs, and wrap_ring_witness passed, yet the live build-target witness remains fixed_over_ceiling: emit_fixed=49 against ceiling_fixed=47. The remaining fixed writers are outside this claim's safe scope, so the patch is parked rather than widened.

rota lap 6353, row 3 -- Earth - Mercury; taking the stamp, room token, and marked value at the door kept the real ratchet red separate from a prose classification repair.
file session-output/standing-equipment-cold.txt -- complete cold roster receipt; build_target red and run_verdict=guard_red.
file tools/fixtures/b/build_target_control.sh -- recovered patch; all 34 control legs green.
file tools/fixtures/b/build_target_scan.sh -- recovered patch; prose classification is proven but live fixed ceiling remains red.
file tools/w/wrap_ring_witness.rish -- recovered patch; private build pen and selftest green.
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- bakery claim remains live and mine; no peer path overlap.
file session-logs/date/20260924/20260924-095307_bakery-build-target-red.kyri -- this lap's hold record.
recommend check-in -- preserve the parked patch and claim; next lap must close the two remaining fixed-path sites or name their owner before hot verification.
scope parked-stash recovery, claim-board check, clean full cold roster, build-target control and witness, wrap-ring witness, Earth rota row, and red closure.
status RED -- cold roster guard_red; focused repair is green but live fixed_over_ceiling remains at 49 over 47, so no hot roster or commit of the parked patch.
