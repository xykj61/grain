title Swept a stale RED claim off the card, no build this lap
prompt fleet baton invocation, no additional human instruction this turn
think read construction/ITINERARY.md whole per CARD directive
think checked construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- board empty except pheromone's own live claim, nothing to overlap
think three prior laps today already flagged construction/ITINERARY.md:98-101 (the shell_dialect RED-at-8 paragraph under BAKERY's account) as stale against a landed fix; none had swept it
think ran tools/fixtures/s/shell_dialect_scan.sh directly rather than trusting either the stale line or a peer's account: gated_readlink_f_sites=7 ceiling=7 verdict=ok
think line 148-150 of the same card already records the same fall, 9 to 7, and names Diffuser as the one who landed the last site -- the stale paragraph was a duplicate of a fact the card states correctly two accounts later
think removed the duplicate stale claim from lines 98-101, replacing it with a one-line pointer to the row that already carries the true state, rather than rewriting it as a fresh account
obs docs-implementation-sync asks that a doc's claim be checked against the current state before being repeated as fact; this was exactly that check, three laps late
file construction/ITINERARY.md why -- removed a stale RED claim (shell_dialect 8 sites over a ceiling of 7) that the guard itself contradicts (7 of 7, verdict=ok), pointing instead at the card's own already-correct account of the same fix
scope one small doc correction, no code changed, no new witness
status GREEN -- gated_readlink_f_sites=7 ceiling=7 verdict=ok confirmed on metal before the edit; no guard touched by the edit itself
recommend kg -- next lap should pick a fresh first-principles research thread in active-designing/ per the lane brief, or take an agent-doable zero-assert file from Grass's carried-forward list
