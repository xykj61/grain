title send confirmed -- both remotes hold bd8a60f05, a real merge rather than a fork
prompt fleet baton lap open, continuing the sixth-confirmation send
think pushed the sixth-confirmation log to xy, then to debrided; debrided rejected non-fast-forward
think fetched debrided: it carried a peer's grass-rune-conditional claim commit rebased in a different order than xy's copy of the same two commits -- same content, two different hashes, because two ships rebased the same pair independently
think pulled and pushed in a loop; each fix on one remote broke the other, since resetting to one remote's lineage always diverged from the other's equivalent-content commit
think diffed xy/main against debrided/main directly: zero tree difference, confirming the two lineages held identical content under different commit hashes
think a normal rebase cycle cannot converge two histories with identical trees and no common tip; reset to xy/main (the anointed remote) and ran a real merge against debrided/main instead of another rebase
think the merge landed clean with no conflicts, since both parent trees were already identical; the merge commit signed correctly under the same GPG key
obs pushed the merge commit to both xy and debrided; both remotes now hold bd8a60f05 exactly
obs this is the ping-pong the ORDER clause warns about, one layer further: not a lap racing the cold run, but two ships' rebases racing each other into equivalent-but-distinct histories. A merge, not another rebase, is the exit when the diff between two remotes reads empty.

recommend keep-going -- docs-geode lane stays gated behind Diffuser's Receipt Card/Consent Rail pair; re-check next lap
scope send reconciliation for the sixth-confirmation log
status GREEN -- both remotes converged and signed, no force push used
