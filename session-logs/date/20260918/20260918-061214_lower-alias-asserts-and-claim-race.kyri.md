title lower_alias.rye takes rune_quad's asserted shape, and a claim collision on rune_triple.rye
prompt fleet loop invocation, no explicit user text this turn -- baton and ITINERARY read for next agent-doable work
think read construction/ITINERARY.md whole; the agent-doable queue named five zero-assert glow/ files remaining past rune_null.rye (landed), rune_mutate.rye (grass), rune_switch.rye (petrichor): rune_quad.rye, rune_triple.rye, lower_alias.rye, lower_cast.rye, glow/nock/nock_jet_dec.rye
think git log showed rune_quad.rye already landed by a peer since the card was written, so checked fleet-claims.kyri and fleet_claim_scan.sh for rune_triple.rye -- read clear
think opened claim pheromone-rune-triple-asserts, staged and committed, rebased against xy/main, and hit a genuine collision: petrichor had opened petrichor-rune-triple-asserts on the same file forty seconds earlier and landed first
think aborted the rebase, reset the claim commit off HEAD, restored to abf35ff6f, and re-pulled xy/main clean rather than trying to force through a duplicate build
think re-ran fleet_claim_scan.sh --check against lower_alias.rye, lower_cast.rye, glow/nock/nock_jet_dec.rye -- all clear, chose lower_alias.rye
think read lower_alias.rye and its sibling lower_quad.rye (already asserted) for the module's shape; lower_alias.rye lowers a parsed =* alias to a Zig pointer, four helper functions with zero bare asserts
think added std.debug.assert import; a postcondition in zig_safe_ident (returned length equals face.len, per zig_ident.rye's own published contract); a postcondition in emit_alias_program (bufPrint's written slice never exceeds the output buffer); a precondition in lower_line (non-empty trimmed line past the empty-source check); two postconditions on the lowered face/source identifiers before they slice their fixed buffers
think opened claim pheromone-lower-alias-asserts, staged both claim files plus the card, committed, pushed to xy -- landed clean this time
think ran glow_lower_alias_witness.rish (GREEN, unchanged assertion counts), tame_style_check (lower_alias.rye dropped off the zero-assert ratchet list), width-check (GREEN, no new usize)
think closed the claim, staged the code plus claim-close plus card, regenerated readme_metrics and geode_libraries (no diff), committed -- then met five consecutive push rejections from a highly contended pier, each requiring a fetch-rebase-reamend cycle
think two of those rebases produced real conflicts in fleet-claims.kyri (a stale copy of my own already-closed claim reappearing against peers' claims arriving and departing) and one in ITINERARY.md's Git nib line -- resolved each by keeping the peer's live claims, dropping my own closed one, and letting the nib line take whichever value and then re-deriving it via remember_git_nib.rish write amend after the rebase settled
obs the ABSENCE clause's check-claim-push-then-build order caught a real collision before any wasted build: rune_triple.rye was claimed by two ships within seconds, and reading the board first meant the withdrawal cost one aborted commit rather than a landed-then-reverted build
obs a highly contended pier (five rejected pushes in a row) is exactly the case the fetch-rebase-reamend loop exists for; never forcing kept every peer's landed work intact through six rebases
file glow/lower_alias.rye -- five bare assert() calls added, same shape as rune_quad.rye/lower_quad.rye's discipline
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- claim opened and closed around the build; conflict resolution kept incense's live claim
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- Git nib carried forward through six rebases to def293e9af's parent
recommend keep-going -- next agent-doable file for this shape is glow/nock/nock_jet_dec.rye (lower_cast.rye is now incense's live claim); check fleet_claim_scan.sh first
status GREEN -- glow_lower_alias_witness, tame_style_check, width-check all clean; pushed to xy and debrided at def293e9a
scope pheromone seat, glow/ language lane, one file
