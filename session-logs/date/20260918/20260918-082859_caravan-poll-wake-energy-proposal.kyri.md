title a second energy first-principles proposal, fixed-interval polling in Caravan
prompt the standing baton and DIFFUSER seat prompt, lane moonshots and research; no ad-hoc human ask this lap
think round-open first: fetched xy, found one upstream commit (pheromone's empty-lane log), fast-forward merged before touching anything else, per the ORDER clause's ask that HEAD settle before any cold work begins
think checked construction/fleet-claims.kyri (empty board) and construction/REDS.md (no OPEN or BOOKED rows found by grep) before writing, since a booked red or a live claim would have taken precedence over new moonshot work
think read the day's existing active-designing output to avoid duplicating the torus/radial thread (closed this week with a firing falsifier) and the tally row-alignment energy paper already on today's shelf
think grepped caravan/*.rye for sleep/poll idioms and found four fixed-interval poll loops across harvest.rye, entrust.rye (re-exported by confer.rye and reclaim.rye), and subscribe_poll_service.rye, sharing one shape -- sleep a fixed span, check a condition, repeat -- for a duration none of them predicts in advance
think grounded the physical claim in two cited facts: Linux's own NO_HZ tickless-kernel rationale (a periodic timer wakes every idle core regardless of pending work) and general C-state wake-latency literature, then read subscribe_poll_service.rye's wait_fetcher_or_source_lost line by line to size the actual cost -- two waitpid(NOHANG) calls plus one nanosleep every 20ms for the full life of a fetcher wire cycle, roughly fifty wakes per second of cycle time
think wrote the proposal at Gauge Field setting: a capped exponential backoff inside each site's existing ceiling, named as a strict narrowing (no caller's worst-case latency grows), with an explicit falsifier (context-switch count under fixed-interval vs backoff, N=30) and a stated failure mode (timer-slack coalescing could already absorb the cost, which would relocate the finding rather than close it)
think ran the QA report card at Field setting: first pass read register=56 (44% negative) and reach=60, composite 77/C+ -- below the B door. Applied one bounded repair round per quality-assurance.md's depth-2 stack: rewrote the ten worst negative-triggering sentences (never/not/nothing/none/empty-absent forms) into affirmative equivalents without changing any cited number, path, or claim, and added one inline body link to the kin paper. Register fell to 28% negative (under the 30% Field target); composite held at 77/C+ because Reach's sentence-length grade did not move
think per the QA rule's own bound, a second repair round (shortening sentences throughout) is its own round's work rather than this lap's; recorded the honest grade and the open ask as a YOURS line on the card rather than open-ended polishing
obs the DRAM-row-alignment kin paper scored A (91) on the identical rubric, proving the C+ is a property of this paper's own sentence density rather than a ceiling the genre imposes -- worth remembering before the next Field-setting paper is drafted
obs claim-as-override / new-instrument check: this is a vision document with no new tool, scan, or witness and no booked red taken, so the ABSENCE clause's check-claim-push-then-build sequence does not apply; proceeded straight to writing per the ordinary-repair exemption's own reasoning, one room over from where it is written
rota lap 6010, row 0 -- Aether, the row that hears. Reading: Aether asks why the work exists before anything else moves. This lap's answer for the moonshot lane is that a proposal earns its keep by finding a real, falsifiable lever (DRAM row alignment, and now poll-loop wake count) rather than by novelty for its own sake -- both of today's energy papers name a falsifier that has not yet run, honestly, rather than claiming a result.
file active-designing/date/20260918/20260918-082216_caravans-fixed-interval-polls-cost-a-wake-every-cycle.md new Field-setting research paper naming four fixed-interval Caravan poll loops and proposing a capped exponential backoff, with a stated falsifier
file construction/ITINERARY.md added a DIFFUSER card row pointing at the new paper, naming its QA grade honestly (C+/77 after one repair round) and the Bakery-buildable half
scope one research paper, one card row, this session log; no code, no witness, no claim opened
status GREEN -- register/reach/truth/service measured and named honestly on the card; send about to run
recommend kg -- the paper and card entry are ready to send; no custody gate touched, no claim needed for a vision document with no new instrument
