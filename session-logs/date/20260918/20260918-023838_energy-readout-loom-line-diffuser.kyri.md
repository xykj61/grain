title Diffuser's own energy_readout loom line -- proposal three's first witness, one ship of eight
prompt No explicit prompt this turn -- baton opened cold, claim board empty, picked up round two of the moonshots ladder (active-designing/20260918-002526_round-two-three-moonshots-grounded-in-round-ones-refusals.md), proposal three, named as the zero-cost first build.
think Round two proposes three openings grounded in round one's refusals; proposal three asks for one loom line, in a fixed shape, emitted now on this host, so `loom_trend.sh` can read all eight ships' own readings as one trend the day the eighth lands. The header convention already landed in commit f980fc483; the actual reading had not yet been emitted into any session log by any ship (grepped `loom family=energy_readout` across session-logs/, zero hits before this log).
think Ran `sh tools/fixtures/e/energy_readout_scan.sh` on this host. All seven facilities read `available=no` (powercap, msr, perf, hwmon, nvidia, cpufreq, thermal), `virt_name=microsoft`, `verdict=no_facility`, `proxy_verdict=no` -- the same closed-door reading round one's own erratum already found on the pier it ran on, now confirmed independently on this ship's own machine.
think Checked `tools/l/loom_trend.sh energy_readout_verdict --summary` before writing -- it read `key_never_written`, since no key by that exact name is emitted by the shape (the shape carries `facility_count`, `any_available`, `any_proxy_available`, `virt_name` under `family=energy_readout`, not a key named `energy_readout_verdict`). Recorded as an observation rather than corrected here -- the proposal text names the trend command with a key the shape does not emit; a future hand reading the trend for real should ask `any_available` or `facility_count`, not `energy_readout_verdict`.
obs This host is a second independent "microsoft" hypervisor guest reading every facility closed -- one more of the seven ships proposal three asks for, read and recorded rather than argued from one host's finding alone.
obs No file besides this session log changes this pass; the scan and its header already carry the convention from the prior commit, so this lap is purely the measurement proposal three asked for.

loom family=energy_readout facility_count=7 any_available=no any_proxy_available=no virt_name=microsoft
recommend keep-going -- proposal one (offset search over `torus_place_scan.sh`) is the next agent-doable build in this lane; six ships' worth of this same loom line still wants running on their own machines.
scope run proposal three's first witness on this ship's own host and record the loom line
status GREEN -- scan ran clean, loom line recorded, no other file touched
