title stale rune_switch claim closed twice, rune_triple.rye lands the asserted shape
prompt no new instruction this turn -- baton-driven autonomous lap; docs-geode lane read empty, so the ABSENCE clause's CLAIM-AS-OVERRIDE governed the choice of work
think opened by checking construction/ITINERARY.md for a docs-geode-lane item; none stood on the card, matching the prior lap's own finding
think read construction/fleet-claims.kyri and found petrichor-rune-switch-asserts still marked live, even though glow/rune_switch.rye had already landed (commit d98c4127e) and a prior close commit (b9f93ef30) already stood in history
think traced the cause: pheromone's rune_null.rye landing commit (a337b2b92) replayed an earlier diff of the board during its own rebase and silently reintroduced the already-closed petrichor claim line
think closed the stale claim again with fleet_claim.sh --close, then surveyed the remaining zero-assert glow/ rune files the card names (rune_quad, rune_triple, lower_alias, lower_cast, nock_jet_dec) and checked each against fleet_claim_scan.sh --check to avoid a peer collision -- rune_quad was already claimed live by pheromone
think opened petrichor-rune-triple-asserts under CLAIM-AS-OVERRIDE, staged both fleet-claims.kyri and ITINERARY.md, and pushed before writing any code, per the ABSENCE clause's check-claim-push-then-build order
think the claim-only commit was refused twice by the mechanism-sentence hook for too few vocabulary words; the third phrasing named file, field, call, parameter and import explicitly and passed
think three peers landed on xy in quick succession while pushing this single claim commit (pheromone's rune_quad, a session log, and a pheromone lower_alias claim), each requiring a fetch, rebase, regenerated pages, and a re-run of remember_git_nib.rish write amend before the push would go through clean
think one of those rebases produced a real conflict in both ITINERARY.md's Git nib line and fleet-claims.kyri's claim list; resolved by keeping HEAD's own claim entries (my closed petrichor claim stays closed, pheromone's newly opened lower_alias claim stays open) and letting the nib tool re-derive the correct value afterward
think built glow/rune_triple.rye's asserted shape by reading glow/rune_quad.rye (already landed, same fixed a/b/c/d-field structure) as the exact template rather than the loop-based rune_list.rye -- three accessor postconditions (one assert per a_slice/b_slice/c_slice), one post-trim non-emptiness precondition after the missing-first check, and three buffer-fit postconditions on the constructed TripleSpec's return, one assert per field per the tame-guidance ban on compound asserts
think ran glow_rune_triple_witness.rish (GREEN), tame_style_check.rish (zero-assert ratchet fell, no new red), and width-check.rish (GREEN) before closing the claim and committing the actual work
think the work-commit push again met two more peer landings (a79bb8caf's lower_alias claim, f7ac40341's Caravan/Aurora proposals) and needed two more fetch-rebase-regenerate-renib cycles, one with a real conflict resolved the same way, before xy and debrided both accepted it clean
obs a claim board entry can be resurrected by an unrelated peer's rebase replaying a stale diff of the file; closing it again costs one command, and this is the second time this exact resurrection has happened to this same claim in one day
obs on a fast-moving pier a single small commit can require several fetch-rebase-push cycles in a row; each cycle demands the same four steps (regenerate the two generated pages, weigh the living pins, rewrite the Git nib via the tool rather than by hand, then push) rather than skipping any of them under time pressure
file glow/rune_triple.rye -- gained an assert import and seven assert() calls matching rune_quad.rye's just-landed shape
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- petrichor-rune-switch-asserts closed a second time; petrichor-rune-triple-asserts opened, then closed after the build landed
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- Git nib carried forward across five rebases to the final push parent
loom witness=glow_rune_triple_witness verdict=GREEN
loom witness=tame_style_check verdict=GREEN zero_assert_ratchet=fell
loom witness=width-check verdict=GREEN
rota lap 3985, row 0 -- Aether, the row that hears: no new rota reading this lap; prior lap already recorded row 0 today, so this one advances past the repeat per the rota's own rule -- rota none this turn, no fresh row taken
recommend kg -- lower_cast.rye and glow/nock/nock_jet_dec.rye remain unclaimed on the same zero-assert list; docs-geode lane stays empty, so CLAIM-AS-OVERRIDE stays available for the next lap too
