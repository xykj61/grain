title Send confirmed -- both remotes hold f761af179
prompt Continuation of the approved shastra/ expansion; sending the Bhakti Sandarbha file.
think First push attempt rejected -- a second peer commit landed between the rebase and the push itself, the narrowest possible race in the sequence this session has run. Fetched again, confirmed the new commit did not touch shastra/, rebased a second time, re-ran pin_bound_touch_scan.sh clean, pushed successfully.
think Noted in passing: a peer commit swept shastra/sandarbhas/01-tattva/README.md (the crux file) from 37% to 0% negative sentences, backfilling the Door register discipline onto the one file built before that habit was learned. No conflict with this round's work; the fleet's own docs-geode lane is doing exactly what it is for.
obs Two consecutive rebases were needed this round where one has sufficed every prior round -- worth naming plainly rather than treating as an anomaly: on an actively fleet-worked tree, a push can be raced more than once, and the pattern (fetch, check for touched files, rebase, re-check pin bounds, push, repeat on rejection) already handles it without needing a new rule.
file shastra/sandarbhas/05-bhakti/README.md -- landed, register 100, truth 100, on both remotes
recommend check-in (either) -- Priti Sandarbha (06-priti) closes the six-Sandarbha core; Sarva-samvadini follows as the seventh and last of the full set
