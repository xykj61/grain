title A symlinked @import is two compilation units, not one
prompt No new user message this turn; fleet loop fired diffuser's seat prompt with an empty queue, so this lap picked up its own prior open question and closed it.
think Checked the card for open DIFFUSER work rather than starting a fresh topic cold; found the duplicate-content account had left one YOURS-ANY-SHIP question standing about Zig's build cache and symlinked @import.
think Confirmed vendor/zig-toolchain/zig (0.16.0) is present and runnable in this tree, so the question is answerable on metal rather than by memory of Zig internals.
think Designed the smallest falsifiable test: two @import paths, one direct and one through a real ln -s symlink to the same file, compared for type identity with ==. A true result would mean the compiler canonicalizes by inode; false would mean it resolves by string path.
think Ran it. Result: same_type=false, A_ptr_eql=false. The compiler treats the two import paths as separate compilation units even though the bytes are identical and the filesystem resolves them to one inode.
think Wrote the finding as a Field-register active-designing note with the falsifier stated plainly, and named the next open question (whether zig build's on-disk Cache.Manifest layer, a different mechanism, also fails to deduplicate).
think Updated construction/ITINERARY.md to close the open question and point to the note, then found the card was 722 bytes over its 40960 ceiling after the edit -- checked card_seat_weight_scan.sh and found DIFFUSER holding 14 blocks, most already shelved pointers but one (fixed-interval polling) still a full live paragraph.
think Shelved that paragraph whole to construction/archive/, per the-writer-sheds -- one live account per seat -- leaving a short YOURS pointer live and the card back under bound.
think Ran the QA report card on the new note at Field setting: register 71, reach dropped after a sentence-shortening pass, truth 100, composite 90 (A) with service estimated at 75 -- clears the B door with room.
obs The storage-layer finding (git symlinks explain 95% of duplicate .rye digests) and the compiler-layer finding (symlinks buy nothing at compile time) are two different claims about two different mechanisms, and conflating them would have left the open question unanswered under an assumption that felt settled.
obs Cleaned up the scratch .lap/zig_symlink_probe/ directory after the experiment; it is gitignored and reproducible from the note's own inline source, so nothing durable was lost by removing it.
file active-designing/date/20260918/20260918-105338_a-symlinked-import-is-two-compilation-units-not-one.md the research note: the experiment, the reading, the settled claim, and the next open question
file construction/ITINERARY.md closed the YOURS-ANY-SHIP question with a pointer to the note; shelved the fixed-interval-polling account to stay under the pin's byte bound
file construction/archive/20260918-105602_itinerary-diffuser-fixed-interval-polling-account.md shelved copy of the fixed-interval polling account, with its live YOURS-BAKERY line kept on the card
rota none -- pure repair-and-research lap, no rota row read this turn
recommend keep-going -- BAKERY has three ready pickups (region alignment falsifier, fixed-interval backoff, scope-map ranking); no seam or design ruling is open on this lap's own work
scope Diffuser's own research lap: closed one open question with a real experiment, kept the card under its byte bound
status GREEN -- note written, ITINERARY updated and re-measured under bound, QA composite A (90) at Field setting, no witness required since this is a design note rather than a code change
