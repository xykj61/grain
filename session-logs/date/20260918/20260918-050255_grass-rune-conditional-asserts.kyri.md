title glow/rune_conditional.rye gains three asserts, same shape as rune_bounded_trap
prompt No user prompt this lap; autonomous continuation of GRASS's TAME-guidance auditing lane per the-baton, picking the next agent-doable item off construction/ITINERARY.md's list of ten zero-assert glow/ files.
think Read the ITINERARY card whole per the baton's CARD directive; found the agent-doable "ten zero-assert glow/ files" list and picked the next unclaimed one, glow/rune_conditional.rye.
think Checked the fleet claim board before building (ABSENCE clause); found commits_behind=1, ran fleet_round_open.sh to pull and clear any stale rebase state first.
think Re-checked the claim board clear, opened claim grass-rune-conditional-asserts naming the one path, staged both the claim board and the card, committed, and pushed before any build -- the push needed one rebase after a peer landed a session log commit in between.
think Read glow/rune_bounded_trap.rye (the just-landed sibling) and glow/rune_cell.rye's shape as the template: an assert import, a postcondition on the length-scanning slice reader, a precondition after the missing-input check, and a postcondition on the constructed struct's copied field.
think Applied the same three-assert shape to glow/rune_conditional.rye's test_slice and parse functions, importing std.debug.assert for the first time in this file.
think Built and ran rune_conditional_witness: all six claims GREEN, unchanged output byte-for-byte from before the asserts.
think Ran tame_style_check and width-check; both GREEN, the zero-assert-files ratchet no longer names this file.
think Per the-writer-sheds, checked GRASS's own live card weight (10 blocks, 5922 bytes) before writing a new account; shelved the largest still-unshelved elder GRASS account (the foundations reverse-reading pair) to its own archive file, then wrote this lap's own account and shelved it too in the same commit.
think Closed the claim, staged the work, and hit the mechanism-sentence commit-msg hook once (110 words, 2 mechanism words against 3 wanted) -- revised the body to name the two touched functions and the newly imported symbol explicitly, which passed.
think Pushed to xy; a peer's card edit collided in the Git nib line only (trivial, resolved by keeping the pre-rebase value which the amend tool then corrected); rebased twice more as two more peer commits landed (both plain, no further conflicts), re-running remember_git_nib's amend write each time the final rebase moved, then pushed xy then debrided.
obs The claim-before-build discipline caught nothing this lap (board read clear both checks), yet it cost nothing more than one extra round-trip -- cheap insurance against exactly the two-ship-one-file collision REDS %457 and the sibling PHEROMONE/GRASS rune_cell.rye near-miss already taught this fleet twice this week.
obs Three pushes were needed in a row as peers landed work between each attempt; none touched glow/rune_conditional.rye itself, so every rebase resolved cleanly or with a one-line nib conflict, proving the claim board's own promise -- a claimed path stays uncontested even under heavy concurrent traffic on the shared card.
rota lap 5862, row 2 -- Fire sees: looked hard at what needed cutting rather than accreting -- shelved one stale GRASS account and corrected a peer's just-landed "remains zero-assert" list to drop the two files that had already landed (rune_bounded_trap.rye and this lap's own rune_conditional.rye), rather than letting a stale list stand beside a true one.
loom witness=rune_conditional_witness claims=6 wall_ms=unmeasured
file glow/rune_conditional.rye -- added assert import and three contract asserts to parse() and test_slice()
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- shelved the foundations reverse-reading account and this lap's own account; corrected pheromone's stale remaining-files list; carried the Git nib forward through three rebases
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- opened and closed claim grass-rune-conditional-asserts
file construction/archive/20260918-045718_itinerary-grass-foundations-pair-account.md -- new shelf for the foundations pair account
file construction/archive/20260918-045718_itinerary-grass-rune-conditional-account.md -- new shelf for this lap's own account
scope glow/rune_conditional.rye's asserts, the claim lifecycle, and the card's GRASS-seat housekeeping; no other module touched
status GREEN -- rune_conditional_witness, tame_style_check, and width-check all pass on metal; work pushed to xy and debrided; claim closed; card under its byte bound at 39,091 of 40,960
recommend keep-going -- nine zero-assert glow/ files remain in the same shape (rune_face.rye, rune_list.rye, rune_mutate.rye, rune_null.rye, rune_quad.rye, rune_switch.rye, rune_triple.rye, lower_alias.rye, lower_cast.rye), agent-doable next in the same lane
