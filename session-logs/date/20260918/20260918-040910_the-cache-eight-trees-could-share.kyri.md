title The cache eight trees could share -- research item 1, closed
prompt Continue the incense overnight loop's next-ordered item: research whether a build cache could be shared across the fleet's eight trees, and write the design.
think Read recursion-prompts/incense-inner.md and confirmed item 3 (pending-decisions reading) already landed at 3c99a22db; moved to item 1, the build-cache research.
think Round-opened, read the claim board (clear), and launched the cold endurance run at HEAD da9285545 per the ORDER clause before building anything.
think Found a stale in-flight cold run from a prior lap whose launch_head no longer matched HEAD; resolved its pid through tools/f/fleet_call.sh --pattern (never a raw pkill/pgrep), confirmed it was this tree's own process, and sent TERM through the bounded helper.
think Investigated the build-receipt mechanism in rye/src/main.rye: a receipt keys on the compiler's bytes, the standard library's bytes, flags, and closure-source content, folding in the currently-running rye binary's own bytes.
think Measured all eight ships' .ryekey sidecars directly (siblings visible as plain directories on this pier, same reach as the captain's view). 1,374 relative paths exist in more than one tree; zero agree on their content key.
think Isolated the cause by comparing inputs directly: vendor/zig-toolchain/zig agrees on all eight (pinned gitlink); rye/src/main.rye agrees on all eight (identical source); rye/bin/rye differs on all eight (locally bootstrapped, no -O flag, Zig's non-reproducible Debug default per the elder bakery receipt-key account).
think Wrote active-designing/20260918-031251_the-cache-eight-trees-could-share.md: the measurement, the mechanism, a proposed content-addressed store, and where it meets the jail law (extending the captain's view's --map precedent to a --rw-map, justified by content-addressed writes being safe under concurrent writers).
think Graded the page: first pass C/71 (register 50% negative against a 30% field ceiling, grade level 16 against an 11 ceiling). Rewrote for affirmative framing and shorter sentences; second pass B+/86.
think Re-launched the cold endurance run at HEAD da9285545 after the essay was written (held still, no commits/edits/pulls, across several re-armed Monitor waits) so the run's tree_moved=no reading would cover the finished page.
think Run closed: tree_moved=no, 322 green, 38 red, 4 gated/skipped, run_verdict=guard_red. Grepped for my own file's path across every red's evidence file -- none reference it. Compared the red set against the standing 15-red set named in recent peer logs (seed_link, instrument_refusal, standing_equipment_redleg, shim_reason, say_compose_bound, query_wire_retention, ratchet_slack, error_member_reach, ignored_walk, build_target, rye_compiled_reach, shared_build_path, pen_release, root_finder, standing_equipment) -- all 15 are present in today's 38, plus roughly 22 more (door_home, foundations_link, backtick_path, comment_path, fold_shelf_link, fold_shelf_link_repoint, opening_lines, vocabulary_collection, index_row_bound, log_has_a_row, built_tool_freshness, glow_rune_alphabet, awk_lcg_exact, ladder_order, aurora_file_placement, rank_outcome, checkable_binding, falsifier_reach, falsifier_form_outcome, verdict_home, commit_parent_claim, mantra_head_door_cost) that read as newly-seated guards elsewhere on the fleet rather than anything this lap touched.
think Round-opened again to land the three commits peers pushed while the cold run held HEAD still; the design essay was stashed and popped back by the round-open's own dead-letter box, intact.
obs None of the 38 reds cite this lap's file or touch a build path this lap wrote to. Named rather than taken, per the fleet's own established convention for a standing set outside one's own lane (the same shape recent peer logs already use). The roughly 22 reds beyond the known 15 are worth a peer or Keaton's glance since the count roughly doubled since 20260917's readings, but diagnosing 22 unrelated guards is well past what one incense lap should absorb into a pure-prose research round.
obs The design essay measures rather than builds: no bootstrap script changed, no store created, no jail touched. The one actionable line it names -- adding -OReleaseSmall to rye/bootstrap.sh -- is cheap and independently verifiable against the elder bakery account's own proof that flag is reproducible for this toolchain.

rota lap none -- pure research and design round, no council-rota row read this lap
scope one design essay answering the overnight order's research item; a full cold endurance run held to completion at fixed HEAD; no code changed, no peer file touched
status GREEN on what this lap did -- the essay stands at B+/86, the cold run closed whole with tree_moved=no, and none of its 38 reds belong to this lap. Sending now.
recommend check in (checkpoint) -- the standing red count roughly doubled since 20260917 (15 to 38); worth a hand's glance at whether that is expected growth from newly-seated guards or a real regression, though nothing in this lap's own reading points at a cause.
