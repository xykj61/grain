title posted ten cross-linked comments on anthropics/claude-code safety-classifier issues
prompt Keaton: reply to all relevant anthropics/claude-code safety-classifier issues following the repo's contributing guidelines, report our Claude Code, nixos, tmux and model-attempt versions, cross-link the postings, note the replies were written with Sonnet 5 not 5.5, and add #98749, #98724, #98558, #98554, #98501 to the list.
think found no CONTRIBUTING.md in anthropics/claude-code; read .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml and config.yml instead for the repo's own norm -- search before filing, one bug per new report, no stated ban on commenting with corroborating detail on an existing report
think gathered our own environment facts directly: claude --version reads 2.1.286, nixos-version reads 26.05.20260920.6d663c0 (Yarara) on channel nixos-26.05, tmux -V reads 3.6a, and .claude/settings.local.json reads claude-sonnet-5-5 even after a bare /model reported setting Sonnet 5
think drafted one shared body plus a one-line issue-specific opener per issue, generated with a short python script, and showed the #98724 draft to Keaton before posting any
think posted with gh issue comment --body-file to all ten issues as the xykj61 account (gh auth status confirmed), each comment cross-linking the other nine
obs #98724's own post matched the repo's issue-template shape (preflight checklist, environment table) more closely than the others cited, so its comment was posted first and named that explicitly
file (none) why-no repository files changed; action was ten GitHub issue comments on an external repository
scope ten public comments posted on anthropics/claude-code under Keaton's own GitHub account; no local files changed
status GREEN -- all ten gh issue comment calls returned a comment URL, none refused
recommend check in (either) -- awaiting whether Keaton wants the earlier feedback draft also sent, or to return to the six remaining standing reds
