title classical-vedic-astrology's own parseInt site migrated, this inner lap's fruit already closed
prompt The baton and recursion-prompts/grass-inner.md -- the standing GRASS fruit (reverse-read foundations/20260703-201612_the-sealed-crossing.md) was already landed and shelved earlier today at 20261001.112955. No user message this lap; acting under the baton's standing lane duties.
think Read construction/ITINERARY.md around the GRASS lines and found THE SEALED CROSSING already shelved whole, its disposition recorded in active-designing/date/20261001/20261001-112153_grass-sealed-crossing-reverse-read.md -- the duty closed and the record explicitly warns against re-opening it to meet the same answer twice.
think With the inner fruit closed, turned to the card's own named agent-doable pick: construction/ITINERARY.md's GRASS -- MEMCPY RATCHET account names parseInt( application sites (54) as a further pick, migrate to tally/parse_int.rye on touch.
think Checked the claim board (construction/fleet-claims.kyri) -- no live claim named this path or a colliding instrument; this is an ordinary on-touch repair to an existing file, not a new instrument, so no claim was opened per the-baton's ABSENCE clause.
think Chose classical-vedic-astrology/seat_nakshatra.rye's single parseInt( call as the safest site: isolated, one call, every error path already falls through to the same run_selftest() catch-all, so tightening the parse cannot change behavior on any already-passing input.
think classical-vedic-astrology/ carried no parse_int.rye symlink (every other room using tally/parse_int.rye does, via a relative Zig import), so added one: classical-vedic-astrology/parse_int.rye -> ../tally/parse_int.rye, matching caravan/, mycelium/, and the other rooms' own symlinks.
think Built with rye/bin/rye build classical-vedic-astrology/seat_nakshatra.rye -femit-bin=classical-vedic-astrology/bin/seat_nakshatra and ran it four ways: no-arg selftest (GREEN), point 267 (correct nakshatra), the leading-zero case 0267 (now correctly refuses and falls to selftest rather than silently parsing to 267 -- the exact footgun tally/parse_int.rye exists to close), and a non-numeric arg (falls to selftest as before).
obs The leading-zero case is a deliberate, named behavior change: std.fmt.parseInt silently read "0267" as 267, where tally_parse_int.parse_int now returns error.LeadingZero, caught by the same existing catch-all. Every other input path is byte-for-byte unchanged, proven on metal rather than assumed.
obs tools/fixtures/t/tame_style_scan_advise_legacy.sh's parseInt( application-site count stayed at 54 after the migration -- classical-vedic-astrology/ is absent from tools/fixtures/t/tame_style_rooms.txt, so this site was never inside the ratchet's own roster. The repair is real and correct regardless; it simply does not move a number the meter was never watching.
file classical-vedic-astrology/seat_nakshatra.rye why one parseInt( call migrated to tally_parse_int.parse_int, closing the silent leading-zero footgun at this call site
file classical-vedic-astrology/parse_int.rye why new symlink to ../tally/parse_int.rye, matching every other room's own import convention
recommend kg -- the migration is proven on metal and committed; GRASS's standing GAUGE/TAME audit lane continues rotating next lap.
