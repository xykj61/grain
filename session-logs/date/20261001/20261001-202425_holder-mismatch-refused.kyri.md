title holder mismatch refused
prompt Keep going. The next case is a revoke whose holder differs from the grant.
think A mismatched holder is not an orphan. The grant is admitted and the grant id matches. Reason gained holder_mismatch, rendered holder-mismatch, on the holder_id field, after that field's own text checks. The revoke slot stays empty and the grant still matches.
think The receipt offer maps the new member, so a reason added without a name still fails to compile. The next case is an incomplete fact or a false signature, one required field at a time.
obs Green: consent_replay_witness and the receipt offer witness, both rebuilt after the Reason member.
rota patchouli's next case is incomplete or false input
