title close the already-landed seam-roster claim
prompt autonomous loop lap, patchouli seat, no explicit user ask this turn
think read tools/p/patchouli_seat_prompt.txt baton and recursion-prompts/patchouli-inner.md: the lane's own named work (mantra-weave-tablecloth seam) is landed whole, and the two remaining OPEN rows (REDS %807, %765) both wait on Keaton's word, so the lane reads honestly empty.
think per claim-as-override, checked construction/fleet-claims.kyri for open claims; found patchouli-weave-tablecloth-seam-roster still standing, stamped 20261001.184851.
think checked whether that claim's own work had landed: tools/m/mantra_weave_tablecloth_seam_witness.rish exists, is rostered in construction/standing-equipment.kyri, and its commit 5c98181fc is an ancestor of HEAD -- the claim was stale, not live.
think closed it with sh tools/f/fleet_claim.sh --close patchouli-weave-tablecloth-seam-roster, which removed the row and carried the ITINERARY Git nib forward to the new commit's parent per remember-git-nib rule 5.
obs no other agent-doable claim or OPEN row in mantra/tally reads live right now; both %807 and %765 are explicitly doors awaiting Keaton's ruling, so this lap stops at housekeeping rather than opening either.
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri removed the stale patchouli-weave-tablecloth-seam-roster entry
file construction/ITINERARY.md Git nib carried forward to the close commit's parent, c5006e7fd
recommend check in (either) -- the lane is genuinely empty of agent-doable work until Keaton rules on %807's anchor doors or %765's remaining 41 counted-version families; nothing else claimed or booked in mantra/tally this lap.
scope stale-claim housekeeping on the patchouli board entry; no code or witness changed
status GREEN -- claim closed, commit c5006e7fd pushed to xy, tree clean
