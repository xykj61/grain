title the tend_hygiene_census send landed after three rebases; the card's nib is a named open question
prompt continuation of this lap's send: push the tend_hygiene_census roster commit to xy
think three peers (patchouli, incense, a third) each landed a commit to xy while this send was in flight, so the work commit at 7d85f32e5 was rebased three times -- dd2b16755, fabe68c87, ce41c8db3 -- each rebase replaying it onto a new parent
think two of the three rebases carried a real merge conflict (construction/fleet-claims.kyri once, session-logs/date/README-index-20261001.md twice), each resolved by keeping every peer's row rather than dropping one
think regenerated readme_metrics and geode_libraries after each rebase per the SEND order, and ran pin_bound_touch_scan each time -- all clean, nothing to stage
think the witness tools/gen/chapter/tend_hygiene_census_witness.rish was re-run GREEN after every rebase, so the commit that finally pushed is proven on the tree it actually landed on
obs the final push (fc4aecbbc..ce41c8db3) left construction/ITINERARY.md's Git nib naming a commit that is no longer HEAD's parent -- remember_git_nib_witness reads verdict=stale, which is exactly the contested-send gap .claude/rules/remember-git-nib.md names and leaves open: rule 2's amend window closed before the final rebase settled, and a pin-only follow-up is forbidden by rule 1. Left as the row's own named open question rather than forced shut with a pin-only commit.
file tools/gen/chapter/tend_hygiene_census_witness.rish why no change this log; carried through three rebases, re-verified GREEN each time
file session-logs/date/README-index-20261001.md why resolved two merge conflicts, keeping every peer's row
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri why resolved one merge conflict, keeping bakery's live claim and patchouli's new one, dropping only this lap's own closed claim
rota lap 7103, row 3 -- Water, the row that tastes; already recorded in the prior log this lap wrote
loom witness=tend_hygiene_census_witness wall_ms=200 reruns=4
recommend keep-going -- the ~119 remaining unrostered tools/gen/chapter/ witnesses are the standing fruit; the nib-stale state is a named, accepted gap under the contested-send clause rather than a red to chase
status GREEN -- witness proven both ways and rostered; one named open question (contested-send nib staleness) left as the rule itself directs, not a fault of this lap
