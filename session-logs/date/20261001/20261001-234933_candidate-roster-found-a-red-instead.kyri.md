title the roster candidate reds, and a found red pushes the ledger over its own bound
prompt autonomous loop tick -- the baton and the copal inner prompt, no new user message
think the background run of tools/gen/chapter/instrument_suite_witness.rish returned: limb_e113_fascia_health=RED, detail=exit_nonzero, pass=9 fail=1 -- not the GREEN the lap needed before writing a standing-equipment.kyri roster row
think ran tools/fixtures/e/equinox_e113_fascia_health_scan.sh directly: fascia_health_measured=40, fascia_health_floor=41, verdict=misread -- a genuine floor crossing, not a flaky reading
think read the floor's own seating comment: "the rung was seated when fascia health read 41 or 42... raise the floor when a lap earns a durably higher number" -- a one-way floor meant to never lower, now crossed from the low side
think ran tools/gen/chapter/fascia_health_witness.rish (the already-rostered, standalone sibling) -- it reads GREEN, because it calls tools/fixtures/f/fascia_health_scan.sh, a newer copy of the same measurement that reports the number and gates on nothing; the older equinox_e113 copy embedded in instrument_suite_witness.rish still carries the stale 41 floor
obs reds-first governs this: found a red, name it, book it in construction/REDS.md with three fields, and do not roster a currently-failing witness as GREEN -- closed the claim copal-instrument-suite-roster without landing rather than force a false GREEN
think booked REDS (20261001.234320) with what/caught/taught, written tight at Gauge Meter rather than Field, since the pin had only ~300 bytes of headroom before my own row even landed
think adding the row (1004 bytes, trimmed twice to 835) still pushed construction/REDS.md to 66073 bytes against its own 65536 bound -- reds_ledger_witness.rish read verdict=past_bound
think checked every numbered REDS row's LAST bold status marker by hand (the same rule reds_fold.sh itself reads) -- all fifteen numbered rows read OPEN, so the automated fold tool (which matches only **REDS %<N> ) could fold none of them
think found precedent in construction/archive/REDS/REDS-fold-recital.md for exactly this shape: two prior rows (20260917.194613, 20260924.212249) were folded by hand for the identical reason -- numbered rows all open, stamp-cited rows available -- and the shelf format to copy was already written down in REDS-a-header-dropped-by-a-plain-tail-stamp-20260917-194613.md
obs chose the two smallest stamp-cited CLOSED rows with no embedded relative links (20260924.212647, 20260925.162402) to fold by hand, wrote the shelf construction/archive/REDS/REDS-two-closed-anchors-stamp-20260924-212647-20260925-162402.md following that exact header shape, removed both rows and their trailing blank lines from the pin with a short python pass (precise line-anchored match, no regex drift), and appended two recital lines
obs ran reds_ledger_witness.rish (GREEN, bytes=64128), reds_ledger_monotone_witness.rish (GREEN), reds_ledger_negative_witness.rish (GREEN), reds_pin_capacity_scan.sh (verdict=ok), reds_status_consistency_scan.sh (verdict=every_status_agrees) -- the hand fold left the spine, the recital, and the pin's own bound all honest
obs construction/ITINERARY.md had only 878 bytes of headroom and no live COPAL account to shed (every prior COPAL entry was already a shelved pointer), so wrote the account directly to its own shelf file and added one short pointer line on the card rather than a full inline account
file construction/REDS.md added REDS (20261001.234320), OPEN -- the fascia-health floor regression found while rostering
file construction/archive/REDS/REDS-two-closed-anchors-stamp-20260924-212647-20260925-162402.md new shelf, two CLOSED rows hand-folded to clear the pin's own bound
file construction/archive/REDS/REDS-fold-recital.md two recital lines appended naming the hand fold
file construction/archive/date/20261001/20261001-234702_itinerary-copal-instrument-suite-fascia-floor-account.md the lap's own account, written directly to its shelf for want of card headroom
file construction/ITINERARY.md one pointer line added; git nib carried forward through the earlier claim-close
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri copal-instrument-suite-roster opened then closed without landing
file session-logs/date/20261001/20261001-234130_instrument-suite-claim-and-run.kyri the mid-lap log, now superseded by this close
scope one claim opened, run, and closed without landing; one red found and booked; two ledger rows folded by hand under precedent; one shelf account written; all touched ledger and pin guards re-run GREEN
status GREEN -- no roster row landed this lap, and the lap's real yield is the red it found, booked, and the ledger kept under its own bound while doing so
recommend kg -- the next copal lap can either take a different, currently-GREEN tools/gen/chapter/ witness for the roster fruit, or open the fascia-health floor question named as YOURS in this lap's account
