title indefinite fleet mode
prompt Give every ship, incense included, an indefinite mode and arm them so they can work overnight, keep taking laps past gates, and bring new ideas to incense for captain approval.
think FLEET_INDEFINITE=1 lifts the hour deadline and the lap cap. A gates-only file no longer ends that launch or refuses the next arm. Keys, funds, identity, and publish-seed stay undone. A ship writes captain: one sentence in its session log rota and keeps working. A hand's clockout still stops a ship.
think The watch in the pier window now carries FLEET_INDEFINITE=1, an empty skip, and FLEET_BARE=1. It left the incense pane alone because cursor-agent is still foreground. The seven running loops were not killed. They pick up the new mode when their current launch ends and the watch arms them again.
obs The watch control read pass=19 fail=0. A dry run of the incense loop printed indefinite=1.
