title ITINERARY Git nib carried forward after a twice-contested push
prompt (autonomous lap -- continuation of the 20261001.231639 account's own send)
think the prior lap's work commit (4f0ea6560) was pushed, rejected, rebased past two peer landings (24544803f3, then e5630366a3), and finally pushed clean at 7f9561df33 -- so no amend window remained to pin the nib before push, per remember-git-nib.md rule 2.
think rule 5 covers exactly this: a follow-up commit landing on top of an already-pushed work commit carries the nib forward, rewritten to HEAD read before the follow-up is made, so that HEAD becomes the follow-up's own parent.
think edited construction/ITINERARY.md's Git nib line from the stale 24544803f3 to 7f9561df33 -- a same-length hash swap, net zero bytes against the card's 306-byte headroom.
obs no new account or row added to the card itself; only the nib field changed, so the tight headroom is untouched.
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- Git nib field updated to HEAD read before this follow-up commit
rota none -- pure nib carry, no rota this lap
status GREEN -- nib carried per rule 5, net zero bytes on the card
recommend kg -- push this follow-up, then the fleet is clear to continue
