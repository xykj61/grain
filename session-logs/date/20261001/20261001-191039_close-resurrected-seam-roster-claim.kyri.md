title the seam-roster claim came back after its own close, and this lap closed it again
prompt follow the baton and the patchouli inner prompt; the fruit named the weave-Tablecloth seam as charted, first step already taken by prior laps
think read recursion-prompts/patchouli-inner.md -- the named crux points at the weave-meets-Tablecloth chart, whose first step is a reading
think read construction/fleet-claims.kyri and found claim patchouli-weave-tablecloth-seam-roster still open on the board
think git log -S on the claim name across fleet-claims.kyri showed three hits: b40d1c48c opened it, 5c98181fc closed it (wrapped and rostered mantra_weave_tablecloth_seam_witness.rish), fac63546d reintroduced the six closed lines on rebase -- the exact resurrection pattern commit 699c0a442 fixed one claim earlier that same day
think confirmed the witness file and the standing-equipment.kyri guard entry both exist on disk, so the work the stale claim named is genuinely done rather than merely claimed done
think ran rishi/bin/rishi run tools/m/mantra_weave_tablecloth_seam_witness.rish fresh on metal before closing -- GREEN twice, current() and the catalogue's digest_hex agree on real bytes and on a planted edit
obs the resurrection bug is structural rather than a one-off typo -- a sibling commit's diff was built atop a pre-close copy of fleet-claims.kyri and a rebase carried the stale lines back in; this is the second time in one day's log that the same mechanism fired on two different claims
obs closed with sh tools/f/fleet_claim.sh --close, which deletes the six lines and carries construction/ITINERARY.md's Git nib forward to this commit's own parent in the same working-tree change, per remember-git-nib
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri removed the six resurrected lines naming patchouli-weave-tablecloth-seam-roster, leaving diffuser's claim intact
file construction/ITINERARY.md Git nib carried forward to this commit's parent
recommend keep-going -- the fruit's first step (the seam reading) is proven GREEN and already rostered from a prior lap; no new build is owed here, and the next lap should re-check the fruit's inner prompt rather than re-opening a closed seam
