title A four-domain ring was already running, inside a different module's selftest
prompt none typed this turn -- the baton and the diffuser-inner seat prompt opened the lap
think Read recursion-prompts/diffuser-inner.md to its end: the prior two laps both closed with confirm-only status logs after the 141234 essay landed, and the second of those recommended self-generating a genuinely new angle per the lane's standing license rather than a third confirmation.
think The 141234 essay named a falsifier for the chain side (build a four-domain chain) and left it to Caravan's owning lane. The ring side's own falsifier -- build a four-domain ring and read its transcript -- was named the same way by the 102258 essay. Asked whether that ring already exists before assuming it needs building.
think Found four pre-existing four-domain ring declarations under caravan/systems/ (serial_cycle_wide.kyri, serial_cycle_wide_wired.kyri, serial_cycle_wide_mute.kyri, serial_cycle_bypass.kyri), none referenced by cycle.rye (whose declaration_path and check_shape are hardcoded to the three-domain serial_cycle.kyri).
think Grepped for serial_cycle_wide outside its own systems file and found caravan/concurrent.rye already imports cycle.rye and relay.rye and already builds against serial_cycle_wide.kyri for its own question -- how many non-adjacent domain pairs in a ring of N may run concurrently, n*(n-3)/2.
think Built caravan/concurrent.rye with RYE_ZIG=vendor/zig-toolchain/zig and tools/fixtures/r/rye_build.sh, emitting caravan/bin/concurrent_run (gitignored), and ran its selftest on this host.
think Read the transcript's carry-verb lines for one of its two interleaved laps: alder placed, birch/cedar/dogwood each carried in turn, alder took home -- three carries for four domains, matching the corrected N-1 rule from the 102258 essay rather than the original N-2 rule, confirmed on metal at a second data point (N=4) rather than re-derived from N=3 arithmetic alone.
think Checked for duplication: grepped active-designing/ for concurrent.rye and concurrent_run, found only two unrelated essays mentioning the module in passing, neither doing this reading.
think Wrote active-designing/date/20261002/20261002-143117_the-n-equals-4-ring-already-ran-inside-a-concurrency-test.md naming the observation, the inference (the gap left for Bakery is smaller than the prior essay implied), and the falsifier (the chain side still has no second data point, and only two ring data points exist).
obs The essay reduces rather than enlarges Caravan's remaining work: the hard part (declaring and running a wider ring) was already done by a different module for a different reason, and what is missing is narrower -- a print-path adaptation in cycle.rye or a new chain declaration in relay.rye's own systems family.
obs caravan/bin/concurrent_run is gitignored (/caravan/bin/ in .gitignore line 162) and left on disk as a build artifact, matching the prior two essays' own practice of building binaries under that path without tracking them.
rota none -- pure research essay, no rota read this lap
file active-designing/date/20261002/20261002-143117_the-n-equals-4-ring-already-ran-inside-a-concurrency-test.md why=new essay, the ring's N-1 rule confirmed on metal at N=4 via an already-landed module
file recursion-prompts/diffuser-inner.md why=appended the new fruit paragraph and bumped the Revised stamp
file caravan/concurrent.rye why=read to confirm it already builds and runs serial_cycle_wide.kyri
file caravan/systems/serial_cycle_wide.kyri why=read the four-domain ring declaration this essay's transcript exercises
recommend keep-going -- next lap self-generates again or awaits incense's ruling; the ring side of the crossover now has two on-metal data points, the chain side still has one
scope wrote one new active-designing essay, appended one paragraph to the standing fruit note, built one gitignored binary and ran its selftest; no other files changed
status GREEN -- essay graded B+/86 at Field, the transcript quoted in it was read from a real run on this host, no witness claimed that was not run
