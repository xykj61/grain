title seventh chapter witness rostered: src_first_resident_witness.rish
prompt baton + copal-inner autonomous lap open
think opened the live board first: construction/fleet-claims.kyri already carried an open claim
think from an earlier commit, copal-src-first-resident-roster, naming
think tools/gen/chapter/src_first_resident_witness.rish as the seventh unrostered chapter witness
think after wayland_study_ledger. Read it as the fruit for this lap rather than picking a fresh
think target, since the claim was already pushed and live.
think per ABSENCE, ran a plain rishi/bin/rishi run on the witness file before touching anything --
think GREEN on metal, 19 Glow desks (2 in src/gate, 17 in src/shape) each lowered, built, and run,
think zero working-tree diff after.
think added the guard record to construction/standing-equipment.kyri, matching the shape of the
think prior six roster entries (guard/path/tier/seated fields, a prose comment above naming what
think the witness checks and why it is read-only).
think ran the scoped standing_equipment_run.sh --detach src_first_resident pass for the second
think proof; it refused on the first try, naming a stale lock held by pid 310042 whose launch_head
think (84ebe82ef3) was no longer HEAD -- a dead pass from an earlier lap. Read the process with the
think bounded tool, fleet_call.sh --pattern standing_equipment_run, confirmed cwd=this tree, sent
think --signal TERM to that one pid by name rather than by a bare pkill, waited for the lock to
think clear (about 20s), then re-ran. Second pass: run_verdict=ok, guards_green=1, tree_moved=no.
think shelved the prior COPAL paragraph (the sixth witness, wayland_study_ledger) whole to
think construction/archive/date/20261002/20261002-045430_itinerary-copal-wayland-study-ledger-account.md
think per the-writer-sheds, left a two-line pointer, and wrote the fresh seventh-witness paragraph.
think pin_bound_touch_scan.sh does not take a bare path argument (misread on the call shape); fell
think back to a plain byte count against the stated 40,960 bound. First draft read 41,031 bytes,
think 71 over; trimmed the new paragraph twice to 40,921, comfortably under.
think closed the claim with fleet_claim.sh --close copal-src-first-resident-roster, which carried
think the ITINERARY Git nib forward to HEAD's own parent in the same step (card_carried=yes,
think card_changed=yes) -- confirmed the nib field and my own card edits both survived the carry.
think fleet_claim_scan.sh --check then read commits_behind=3, so ran fleet_round_open.sh before
think committing: stashed this lap's own changes first, let round-open adopt the anointed order to
think 4393215bc7 (nine dead-letter logs, eight dead-letter files named and left alone, none in this
think lane), popped the stash cleanly, and reconfirmed the card's byte count and the fleet-claims
think net-empty diff against the new HEAD.
obs the net diff on construction/fleet-claims.kyri against the pre-lap HEAD is empty -- the claim
obs was opened by an earlier commit and closed by this one, matching the pattern the fifth and
obs sixth roster laps already set.
obs 110 unrostered tools/gen/chapter/ witnesses remain (measured this lap by diffing the file list
obs against the guard names already in construction/standing-equipment.kyri), down from ~111 named
obs on the sixth roster's own account.
obs the stale-lock refusal taught the exact shape the-baton's FLEET clause already names: resolve
obs the pid with the bounded tool, confirm it is inside this tree, name the signal rather than
obs reaching for a bare pkill, and wait out the TERM-lands-when-the-guard-returns window rather
obs than escalating to SIGKILL.
file tools/gen/chapter/src_first_resident_witness.rish -- read-only, proven GREEN twice; no edit
file construction/standing-equipment.kyri -- new `guard src_first_resident` record, tier lap
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- prior COPAL paragraph shelved whole; fresh seventh-witness
file paragraph written; Git nib carried forward by the claim close
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- claim opened by an earlier commit, closed by this one; net
file diff empty
file construction/archive/date/20261002/20261002-045430_itinerary-copal-wayland-study-ledger-account.md
file -- new shelf holding the sixth-witness account whole
recommend kg -- the open claim is landed and closed; 110 unrostered chapter witnesses remain for a
recommend future lap, matching this lap's own precedent. Nothing blocks continuing the same fruit.
rota lap 3590, row 3 -- Water, the row that tastes. Read for what the lock's own evidence weighed
rota rather than its first appearance: a held lock looked like a live conflicting pass, and reading
rota its launch_head against current HEAD showed it was already a dead one from an earlier lap --
rota the same lesson the baton's ORDER clause teaches about a verdict fixed before it is read.
scope one chapter-witness roster, one stale-lock clear via the bounded signal tool, one round-open
scope mid-lap, one claim close, one card paragraph shelved and rewritten.
status GREEN -- src_first_resident_witness.rish proven both ways, claim closed, card under bound,
status ready to commit and push.
