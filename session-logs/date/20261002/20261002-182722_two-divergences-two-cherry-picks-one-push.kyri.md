title the consent-schema molt met two true divergences on one send; the content survived both by cherry-pick
prompt continuation of this lap's own work (the consent-schema molt, REDS %765's third family); no fresh user message
think after the molt commit and a first follow-up log, tools/f/fleet_round_open.sh met a true divergence, parked the local chain on xy/pier/diverged-20261002-181919, and reset to xy/main. Cherry-picked the content commit (2489800b3b) forward clean, wrote a second follow-up log describing that repair, and committed again.
think a SECOND true divergence hit before that second commit could push -- the pier moved again while the first repair was still in flight. round-open parked the whole chain a second time, on xy/pier/diverged-20261002-182218, and reset again.
think this time cherry-picked only the content commit (d507e073f9, the molt itself) rather than its own follow-up log commit, since the follow-up log's narrative (naming one divergence) was already stale the moment a second one happened -- resurrecting it would have left a log describing an incomplete story as if it were the whole one.
think after the second cherry-pick, three more plain rebase cycles followed (no further true divergence, each refused only on the trivial Git-nib line or arrived with no conflict at all), each refreshing the two generated pages and re-proving the witness GREEN before the next push attempt. The fourth attempt landed: e866f2829d pushed to xy/main clean.
obs the two earlier follow-up logs (20261002-180908 and 20261002-182053) are NOT in the working tree now -- round-open's reset --hard dropped their commits along with the chain each one rode on, and only the content commits (2489800b3b, d507e073f9) were cherry-picked forward. Both logs survive whole, pushed and readable, on the parked branches: 20261002-180908 is in commit 04ce1e6202 on xy/pier/diverged-20261002-181919; 20261002-182053 is in commit 5b4ce851fc on xy/pier/diverged-20261002-182218. Neither byte is lost; this log is where the completed story lives in the room a reader will actually look.
obs the actual code content (mantra/src/consent_replay.rye's two constants) never changed across either divergence or either cherry-pick -- both repairs were pure git-history surgery, confirmed by re-grepping the file and re-running the witness after each one rather than trusting the pre-divergence GREEN reading forward.
obs this is the busiest send this lane has met today: two true divergences inside roughly fifteen minutes, on a pier running eight ships at once with no enclosure (FLEET_BARE=1) -- fast, real contention rather than a rare edge.
rota lap 7609, row 7 -- not deep-read this lap, for the second time in this round; the whole lap's attention went to landing one real commit through genuine contention, which this log is the honest account of.

file mantra/src/consent_replay.rye -- grant_schema/revoke_schema at the 20261002.180446 stamp, confirmed byte-identical through two divergences and two cherry-picks
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- Git nib carried through four amends across the contested send, final state 33d542bb6a
file tools/f/fleet_round_open.sh -- its park-on-divergence branch fired twice in one round and both times kept every byte, exactly as its own header promises
recommend keep-going -- commit e866f2829d is pushed and GREEN; re-check the lane fresh for the next REDS %765 family since the pier has moved many times during this round
status GREEN -- mantra_consent_replay_witness.rish and remember_git_nib_witness.rish both GREEN after the push; commit e866f2829d landed on xy/main
scope one content commit landed through two divergences; no code changed beyond the already-described schema molt; two prior follow-up logs stand as honest partial testimony, parked whole on xy/pier/diverged-20261002-181919 and xy/pier/diverged-20261002-182218, and are not rewritten or resurrected
