title the Git nib field repointed after the rebase landed
prompt Continuation of the same lap -- sending the falsifier essay commit met a conflict on the Git nib line during the round-open pull.
think git pull --rebase xy main conflicted on construction/ITINERARY.md's Git nib line against a peer's own landed commit; resolved to the pre-rebase base hash by hand, which turned out stale once the rebase actually finished replaying on top of the peer's commit.
think rishi/bin/rishi run tools/r/remember_git_nib.rish after the rebase and push named HEAD's parent as 1b1fc5fbd6, which did not match the dd1e25ffb5 the conflict resolution had written -- the work commit was already pushed to xy, so amending it would need a force-push, which stays forbidden without Keaton's explicit word.
think Landed the correction as a follow-up commit instead, per remember-git-nib.md rule 5: the nib names HEAD (84e23c41a6, the just-pushed work commit) read before the follow-up is made.
obs A rebase conflict on the Git nib line is exactly the contested-send case remember-git-nib.md's rule 5 section names as still open; this lap's repair used the rule's own escape (a follow-up commit) rather than leaving the field stale or force-pushing.
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- Git nib field corrected from the stale dd1e25ffb5 to the pushed work commit 84e23c41a6
status GREEN -- both commits (84e23c41a6 and 016834f77d) are pushed to xy, tree is clean, no force-push used
scope one one-line correction to a pin field, landed as a follow-up commit after a rebase conflict
recommend keep-going -- open claim/instrument checks are clear; next self-generated fruit or a round-open check is due
