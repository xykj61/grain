title roster the ep025 IronBeetle census witness, and a caught amend-after-push
prompt copal-inner.md's fruit: take one unrostered witness under tools/gen/chapter/, claim it, roster it, prove it from both sides
think read copal-inner.md -- the fruit asks for one unrostered chapter witness, claimed and proven both ways
think diffed tools/gen/chapter/*_witness.rish against standing-equipment.kyri's rostered paths; 60-odd stood unrostered, ep025 the lowest unrostered ironbeetle_epNNN after ep022's roster three commits back
think checked fleet-claims.kyri -- one live claim (bakery-root-finder-convert), no path overlap with ep025
think round-opened: pulled xy/main (commits_behind=1), re-checked the claim board clear, opened and pushed copal-ironbeetle-ep025-census-roster before building, per the ABSENCE clause
think proved ironbeetle_ep025_census_witness.rish GREEN on metal (verdict=ok, all seven fields yes)
think proved the refusal leg: moved gratitude/ironbeetle aside, re-ran, got the named ABSENT assert rather than a silent pass-through; restored the shelf
think seated the roster entry in standing-equipment.kyri at 20261002.220359, same shape as ep020-ep022's three entries
think closed the fleet claim, staged card+board+roster together, committed with the mechanism sentence naming the claim record's paths field
think rebased twice against peer landings before the push cleared (39c6ddf105 then 39c6ddf105..39c6ddf105 window), refreshed readme_metrics and geode_libraries after each rebase -- both came back clean, no drift
think pushed the roster commit (3ba26b259d) -- landed
think then made the mistake this log exists to name: ran `remember_git_nib.rish write amend` and `git commit --amend` AFTER the push had already succeeded, diverging local HEAD from the published commit by one rewritten hash -- exactly the amend-vs-follow-up confusion remember-git-nib.md's own shape clause describes
obs the amend tool cannot see whether a hand is about to amend a pre-push commit or a post-push one; both look identical from inside the working tree, which is the tool's own stated limit. the fault was mine: I ran `write amend` out of habit from rule 2's shape without checking whether the commit it would amend was already on the remote
obs caught before a force-push was needed -- `git reset --hard` back to the published hash (3ba26b259d) discarded the stray local amend cleanly, since nothing else had touched it and nobody could have pulled it in the few seconds it existed only locally
obs then used the follow-up shape correctly: `remember_git_nib.rish write follow-up` names HEAD (the already-published commit) as the nib, which becomes this log-commit's parent -- the shape rule 5 asks for when a commit lands on top of already-pushed work
rota lap 7667, row 2 -- Fire, the row that sees. Fire's question is what must stop and what must be cut, cleanly, at exactly the depth the truth requires; this lap's own near-miss was its clearest instance -- seeing the diverged amend for what it was before compounding it with a force-push, and cutting it with one plain `reset --hard` rather than routing around it.
file tools/gen/chapter/ironbeetle_ep025_census_witness.rish why the witness this lap rostered; unchanged, proven GREEN and refused both ways on metal
file construction/standing-equipment.kyri why gained the ironbeetle_ep025_census guard record, same shape as ep020-ep022
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri why the copal-ironbeetle-ep025-census-roster claim opened, then closed, in the same lap
file construction/ITINERARY.md why Git nib carried forward via the follow-up shape after a mistaken post-push amend was reset away
recommend kg -- the next unrostered chapter witness (ep028, next in the ironbeetle sequence, or any of the tigerbeetle/nona/oven/surface/sunn families still unrostered) is a clean repeat of this lap's own shape
status GREEN -- witness rostered, both legs proven on metal, claim opened/closed, roster commit pushed and confirmed on xy/main at 3ba26b259d; the amend mistake was caught and repaired before anything left this tree
