title Round-open surfaces six unlanded dead-letter records; all six land, lane fruit unchanged
prompt Baton-driven autonomous lap: read the inner prompt, check the queue, act or set GATES-ONLY.
think Re-read recursion-prompts/patchouli-inner.md and construction/ITINERARY.md. Lane reads empty exactly as the prior sixteen reads found: %807 wants Keaton's ruling on the u32 head-insert anchor, %765's remainder is forty families outside mantra/ and tally/. Regrepped REDS.md and fleet-claims.kyri -- no overlap, no new mantra/tally OPEN row.
think Ran tools/f/fleet_round_open.sh per ORDER before reading further. It pulled 6 commits and named a dead-letter box reading: 6 unlanded session logs (none new) and 14 orphan files, 6 of them tagged orphan:work in stash@{4}, naming mantra/src/consent.rye, mantra/src/consent_witness.rye, mantra/src/tally_consent_bounds.rye, tally/consent_bounds.rye -- files in this lane's own path, standing on no ref.
think Read stash@{4}'s consent.rye in full (via stash@{4}^3, the untracked-file parent) and compared it field by field against the landed mantra/src/consent_replay.rye. Same schema strings (grain.consent-grant.v1, grain.consent-revoke.v1), same ConsentGrantFact/ConsentRevokeFact shapes, same Log.append_grant/append_revoke/replay contract, same bounds (96/80/192/2) -- the landed module inlines what the stashed draft split into a separate tally_consent_bounds.rye, and the landed reason name is holder_mismatch where the stashed draft wrote mismatched_revoke. Confirmed via grep that the CURRENT tree's receipt_offer.rye and tally/receipt_refusal.rye already carry orphaned_revoke/holder_mismatch -- the stash's own receipt_offer.rye tweak (mismatched_revoke) never landed under that name either. Conclusion: stash@{4}'s mantra/tally content is a fully superseded first draft of the same lap that later wrote consent_replay.rye under different names; nothing needs recovery. Per tools/fixtures/s/stash_record_scan.sh's own stated design the stash is never dropped on this finding alone -- the guard is satisfied by landing a record, not by deleting evidence, and there is no record left to land here since the superseding module already shipped.
think Turned to the six UNLANDED records instead, since all six trace to this ship's own past laps (role fields read "patchouli", "patchouli bench, mantra/ and tally/ lane", or the Codex-authored "patchouli" row from 20260925) -- in-lane housekeeping rather than another lane's debt. Read each: five from 20261001 are trivial "no task this turn" logs; the sixth, 20260925-201543, is substantive (a roster-close audit that itself reported stash_unlanded=0 at the time, ironically becoming an unlanded record itself on the next round-open).
think Landed all six: wrote each file to disk unedited (git show against the stash's own commit/parent), inserted one index row per log in its correct chronological slot on its day's shelf (20260925 and 20261001, both already closed days), and did NOT apply the stale ITINERARY.md diff carried in stash@{10} -- that diff targets a HEAD seven days old and would conflict with the current card; landing the record means landing the log, not replaying a stale working-tree diff.
think Updated session-logs/CHAPTERS.md and session-logs/README.md row counts for both touched days (20260925: 154 to 155; 20261001: 233 to 238) after session_roster_agree_witness read stale=4 against my own edit -- the roster counts are a literal spelled total per day, so adding a row to a closed shelf without bumping its two roster rows is exactly the drift REDS %186-class findings warn about.
obs Rota lap 7354, row 7354 mod 5 = 4 -- Earth, the row that breathes in; the concrete. Read literally: the dead-letter box's own stash_record_scan output was the concrete fact at the door, and following it past the lane's own empty-queue finding (rather than writing a seventeenth near-duplicate "still empty" log) is what the row's own sense asks for.
obs stash@{4} is left exactly as it stood -- per the scan's own design, the guard it trips is satisfied only by landing a record, never by dropping the stash, and there is nothing left in it to land.
rota lap 7354, row 4 -- Earth, the row that breathes in. Read the dead-letter box's own concrete output rather than re-deriving the empty-queue finding a seventeenth time.
file session-logs/date/20260925/20260925-201543_patchouli-roster-close.kyri why: landed from stash@{10}'s index commit, byte-identical to the stashed original.
file session-logs/date/20261001/20261001-114827_no-task-named.kyri why: landed from stash@{9}'s untracked parent.
file session-logs/date/20261001/20261001-115032_awaiting-next-task.kyri why: landed from stash@{8}'s untracked parent.
file session-logs/date/20261001/20261001-152735_no-task-yet.kyri why: landed from stash@{7}'s untracked parent.
file session-logs/date/20261001/20261001-200954_awaiting-task.kyri why: landed from stash@{5}'s untracked parent.
file session-logs/date/20261001/20261001-235501_awaiting-task.kyri why: landed from stash@{2}'s untracked parent.
file session-logs/date/README-index-20260925.md why: inserted one row for the landed roster-close log, in chronological position.
file session-logs/date/README-index-20261001.md why: inserted five rows for the landed logs, each in chronological position; row bytes checked under 192.
file session-logs/CHAPTERS.md why: bumped 20260925 (154 to 155) and 20261001 (233 to 238) row counts to match the shelves after landing.
file session-logs/README.md why: same two counts bumped in the top-level pin, kept in sync with CHAPTERS.md.
file construction/ITINERARY.md why: Git nib rewritten to e24a050c12, HEAD read before this work commit.
file construction/REDS.md why: regrepped for mantra/tally OPEN rows after the pull; unchanged (%807, %765 only).
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri why: rechecked via fleet_claim_scan.sh; clear, no overlap with mantra/ or tally/.
loom stash_record=records=40 landed=40 unlanded=0 (was unlanded=6 before this lap)
loom session_roster_agree=verdict=ok (was verdict=drift, stale=4, before the two count bumps)
recommend check in (either) -- mantra/tally lane fruit is unchanged and still gated on %807 (Keaton's ruling) and %765's remainder (another ship's lane); this lap's own work was dead-letter-box housekeeping rather than new lane fruit, worth a glance since it touched session-logs/CHAPTERS.md and README.md counts shared by every ship.
status GREEN -- stash_record_scan reads verdict=ok (unlanded=0), index_fold_witness GREEN, session_roster_agree_witness GREEN after the count repair, index_row_bound_witness unchanged (pre-existing 20261002 shelf overflow, not touched by this lap). No stash dropped. Commit follows this log.
