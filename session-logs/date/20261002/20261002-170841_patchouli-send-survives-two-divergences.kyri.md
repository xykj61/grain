title The claim-close send survived two true divergences on a busy pier
prompt Follow-up to 20261002-170141_patchouli-closes-own-landed-claim.kyri: send the commit.
think The first push attempt after committing hit a true divergence -- tools/f/fleet_round_open.sh parked the local commit on pier/diverged-20261002-170410, pushed that branch for safety, and reset main to the anointed xy/main. Cherry-picked the parked commit back onto the new tip; only the Git nib line in construction/ITINERARY.md conflicted, resolved to the cherry-pick's new parent.
think A second push attempt met a second true divergence (another peer landed a commit in the gap) -- round-open parked again on pier/diverged-20261002-170700, pushed it, reset main. This cherry-pick conflicted in construction/fleet-claims.kyri: the landed peer commit ("construction: roster the ironbeetle ep013 census witness") had just closed copal's own claim in the same region my commit closed patchouli's, so both removals needed keeping rather than picking one side. Resolved by dropping both claim records and kept bakery-root-finder-convert and incense-skate-event-ring-walk untouched; re-amended the Git nib to the new parent.
think Pushed a third time and it landed clean, 8663ae0450..b60acd9654.
obs Two true divergences in roughly six minutes says this pier is running hot across several ships right now; neither local commit was ever at risk since fleet_round_open.sh parks and pushes the diverging line before resetting, which is exactly the safety property the contested-send problem (REDS %803's open half) still leaves unresolved for a harder case -- this lap's conflicts were trivial two-line nib and claims-board collisions, never a real content conflict.
rota lap 7543, row 3 -- Water, the row that tastes; no new reading pressed this round, the rota field was already recorded on the originating log this follow-up completes.
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- Git nib amended twice across the two re-derivations, finally resolved against HEAD's true parent 8663ae0450
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- resolved a real two-sided conflict, dropping both patchouli's and copal's now-landed claims in the same merge
scope git mechanics only: round-open, cherry-pick, conflict resolution, push, repeated twice. No further code or prose changed beyond the prior commit's own content.
status GREEN -- commit b60acd9654 landed on xy/main; mantra/tally lane still has no agent-doable fruit
recommend check in (either) -- same standing recommendation as the originating log; nothing new surfaced in this lane during the send.
