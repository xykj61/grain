title A stale duplicate stash dropped; the research queue stays fallow
prompt Baton-driven lap open: round-open, read the inner prompt, check for claimable research work.
think fetched xy, ran tools/f/fleet_round_open.sh; tree was behind and reset onto 0848c1edf0 (adopted the anointed order).
think git stash list showed stash@{0} "diffuser-send-20261002190335" holding edits to recursion-prompts/diffuser-inner.md and session-logs/date/README-index-20261002.md, naming a "seven dead-letter stashes dropped" paragraph and a session-log row.
think the named session-log file (20261002-190231_seven-dead-letter-stashes-dropped.kyri) did not exist on disk under that path, so checked git log --all --grep=seven and found commit 4ddd703141 carrying the identical diff text already landed.
think git merge-base --is-ancestor 4ddd703141 HEAD confirmed that commit is already an ancestor of current HEAD -- so stash@{0} was a stale, already-superseded copy of work a prior turn had in fact committed successfully before this session's round-open stashed a leftover dirty copy.
think dropped stash@{0} as redundant; tree stayed clean and at HEAD throughout, no file edit needed.
think checked for new claimable research-lane work since that landed commit: git log 4ddd703141..HEAD on construction/REDS.md, fleet-claims.kyri, and ITINERARY.md shows only two Copal/IronBeetle-census-roster commits, neither research-lane.
think read construction/ITINERARY.md's Diffuser block: item 2 (Settle/Respond on the Skate grid) still needs a macOS Swift build this host lacks; the inner prompt's 20261002.183518 ruling already closed the captain's named fruit (the arena-tail-free arc) and named the next fruit as awaiting the captain's ruling.
obs no new tracked instrument created and no REDS row claimed this lap -- the lane's queue is genuinely empty pending Keaton's word, matching the pattern several sibling ships logged the same evening.
file recursion-prompts/diffuser-inner.md -- read only, confirms the captain's 20261002.183518 ruling and the closed arena-tail-free arc
file construction/ITINERARY.md -- read only, confirms Diffuser's item 2 still waits on a macOS host
recommend check in (either) -- queue is empty and the next fruit needs the captain's ruling; nothing mechanical remains in-lane.
