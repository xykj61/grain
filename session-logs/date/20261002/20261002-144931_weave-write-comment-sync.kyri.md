title mantra/src/main.rye: sync the weave-serialization comments to what it writes
prompt THE BATON (round-open), then patchouli-inner.md's ruling of 20261002.142242: the agent-doable queue is the next chronological-header family in mantra/ or tally/, and when the scan finds none, stop.
think Read recursion-prompts/patchouli-inner.md. %807 stays closed to this lane (Keaton's ruling). %765's remainder wants another ship's own lap; this lane's own candidate is a chronological header still open in mantra/ or tally/.
think Grepped mantra/ and tally/ for a live "-v<N>" write header. mantra-commit already molted to mantra-commit-20261001.233015 (prior lap). mantra-weave's write header is ALSO already molted -- serialize_weave at mantra/src/main.rye:235 emits mantra-weave-20260916.101910 via Weave.to_order_record, per REDS %765's own account.
think So no fresh %765 family stood open in this lane. Before calling the queue empty, read main.rye's own Section Weave serialization banner (written pre-molt, at the %680/20260909-20260910 arc) against the serialize_weave/deserialize_weave code it describes.
think Found the drift: the banner, the record-shape list, and both the serialize_weave and deserialize_weave docstrings still read "this CLI WRITES mantra-weave-v2" and "every blob written from here forward is mantra-weave-v2" -- a claim the code stopped making once the order-record molt landed. The Commit section just below it (written later, at the %765 molt) correctly narrates the weave's own earlier molt in passing, so one file held an accurate account in one section and a stale one in the section above it.
think This is docs-implementation-sync's own subject: a doc's claim about behavior is an assertable invariant, checked rather than believed. Rewrote the four passages to name all three records (v1 elder-read, v2 elder-read, the stamped order record written-and-read), keeping every word about the elder two records and correcting only the false "written" claims.
obs No logic touched -- only /// and // comments. mantra_cli_record_witness.rish (which drives the real CLI's serialize/deserialize pair through a pen) still reads GREEN, nine readings and six planted breaks caught; a plain rye build of main.rye to a throwaway binary is clean.
obs This stayed an ordinary repair to an already-existing file (the-baton's ABSENCE clause), so no fleet-claims board entry was opened for it -- ironbeetle census claims from petrichor and copal already stand on the board for their own lanes, untouched.
rota lap row unmeasured this lap -- a pure comment repair, no rota read taken this round.
file mantra/src/main.rye why: the Section Weave serialization banner, its record-shape list, and the serialize_weave/deserialize_weave docstrings named the wrong currently-written header; corrected to the stamped order record REDS %765 already landed.
scope mantra/src/main.rye comments only, patchouli lane (mantra/ and tally/)
status GREEN -- mantra_cli_record_witness.rish re-run after the edit, nine readings and six planted breaks caught; a plain rye build of main.rye to a throwaway binary is clean
recommend check in (either) -- this lane's agent-doable queue (per patchouli-inner.md's 20261002.142242 ruling) reads empty again after this repair: %807 wants Keaton's word, %765's remainder wants another ship, and no further chronological-header or doc/code drift surfaced in mantra/ or tally/ on this pass. Claim-as-override toward another lane's booked work is the next door if the seat keeps going.
