title a contested send parked the gate-set log rather than losing it; lane still empty
prompt autonomous fleet lap -- baton-prepended seat prompt, no fresh user message
think committed 46ee1cc909 (the sixth empty-lane confirmation, .loop-gates-only set) and tried to push; xy/main had moved, so I re-ran tools/f/fleet_round_open.sh and retried the push five times across a few minutes, each time losing the race to another ship's commit.
think on one of those round-opens the script met a true divergence (its own merge-base ancestry tests both failed, and git rebase xy/main itself refused), so it took its documented branch: park the local line on a pier/diverged-<stamp> branch, push that branch, then git reset --hard xy/main.
think checked git reflog and found the sequence directly -- rebase (start), rebase (abort): returning to 46ee1cc909, then reset: moving to xy/main at f3464f7170 -- which read at first glance like a lost commit.
think confirmed no byte was lost: xy/pier/diverged-20261002-174209 carries 46ee1cc909 whole, exactly as tools/f/fleet_round_open.sh's own header promises (every byte kept, every push stays fast-forward, a local line the re-derivation refuses is parked rather than dropped).
think decided against re-deriving and re-pushing that parked commit: five more real commits have landed since (ironbeetle ep015 claimed and rostered, five Region.clear() call sites, a diffuser release-gesture essay), so the "sixth confirmation" framing in the parked log is already stale, and resurrecting a stale status log would cost a reader more than it tells them.
think re-read construction/fleet-claims.kyri at the fresh HEAD (5663104585): three live claims stand (bakery-root-finder-convert, incense-linengrow-witness-walker, copal-ironbeetle-ep015-census-roster), none touching glow/, mantra/src/receipt_offer.rye, or consent_replay.rye -- the pheromone lane is still genuinely empty.
obs the fleet_round_open.sh park-on-divergence path worked exactly as its own comments describe, under real contention, in minutes rather than as a thought experiment -- a small positive confirmation of a guard this tree already trusted on paper.
rota lap 7577, row 7 -- not deep-read this lap; the lap's whole attention went to the contested send itself, which is this seat's own honest account rather than a rota substitute.
file construction/fleet-claims.kyri -- re-read fresh at HEAD 5663104585; still names no claim inside this lane
file tools/f/fleet_round_open.sh -- read in full to understand the park-on-divergence branch after meeting it live
scope housekeeping lap: one commit made and intentionally left parked rather than pushed (xy/pier/diverged-20261002-174209 carries it), five round-open pulls absorbed, no code touched
status GREEN -- no data lost; the parked commit's content is superseded by this log, which stands in its place
recommend check in (either) -- the lane is idle on Keaton's word for the next Glow rune; .loop-gates-only remains set from the prior lap and this lap found nothing to change that
