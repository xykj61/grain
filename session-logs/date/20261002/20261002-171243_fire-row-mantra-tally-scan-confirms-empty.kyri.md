title The chronological-header scan the fruit asks for, run fresh, still finds none
prompt (autonomous lap -- the inner prompt's own queue instruction: scan mantra/ and tally/ for another %765 family before stopping)
think Read recursion-prompts/patchouli-inner.md whole. Its newest ruling (20261002.142242) names the one open door: find a chronological header that still lives in mantra/ or tally/; when the scan finds none, say the queue is empty and stop.
think Grepped mantra/ and tally/ for counted version strings ("-v1", "-v2" and siblings). Found four: mantra-weave-v1/v2 and mantra-commit-v1/v2 in mantra/src/main.rye, plus fixture-signature-v1/v2 (test data, not a store header) and unique-b-v2 (a sync fixture name, same reason).
think Read main.rye around both pairs. serialize_weave writes only "mantra-weave-20260916.101910"; the v1/v2 literals live inside deserialize_weave's own elder-reader branches, each with a comment naming it read-only from its molt date forward. serialize_commit/deserialize_commit show the identical shape: the write path emits "mantra-commit-20261001.233015" and the v1/v2 literals are dispatch targets for read_commit_v1/read_commit_v2, both already named as elder compatibility in the 20261001.233015 molt account this lane landed.
think So both record families this lane owns already carry their chronological header on the write side; what remains are the elder headers the law asks to keep forever. No third family surfaces in either directory.
obs Checked REDS.md for any OPEN row naming mantra/ or tally/ besides %807 -- none. Checked fleet-claims.kyri -- no live claim touches this lane, and no BOOKED row anywhere in the ledger stands unclaimed and agent-doable. The newest ruling in the inner prompt (stop rather than reach for claim-as-override) is the more specific and more recent instruction, so this lap does not claim another lane's work.
obs Ran fleet_round_open.sh to stay current before closing: fast-forwarded 0db14365f8 to 50a2111f17 (a peer's session log, no conflict), confirmed the dead-letter stash box is unchanged from the prior lap's reading.
rota lap 7544, row 4 -- Earth, the row that breathes in; the concrete fact at the door this round was the four counted-version literals themselves, read in place in main.rye rather than argued about from memory of the prior molt account.
file recursion-prompts/patchouli-inner.md -- read whole, no change; its own 20261002.142242 ruling is what this lap followed
file mantra/src/main.rye -- read lines 170-330 and 580-630; no change, both record families already write their chronological header
scope read-only confirmation lap: one grep, one round-open pull, no code or prose touched
status GREEN -- mantra/tally lane confirmed to have no agent-doable fruit; nothing booked, nothing claimed
recommend check in (either) -- the lane's queue is empty by the inner prompt's own test; Keaton's word on %807 (the zero-reservation door) or a fresh %765 family surfacing elsewhere are the only doors that reopen it
