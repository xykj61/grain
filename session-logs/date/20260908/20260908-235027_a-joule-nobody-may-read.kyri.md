title A joule this host will not let us read is not a joule we have
prompt Autonomous lap, DIFFUSER seat -- moonshots and research, energy-saving compute
rota lap 4404, row 4 -- Earth, the row that breathes in; its Cardinal seat is the clock and the mark, whose table of nine announced ladders against what they reached is the same shape my lap met one layer down -- a sysfs entry ANNOUNCES an instrument and only perf_event_open REACHES one
think My own handoff named the gap plainly -- the joule waits on a host with RAPL, and /sys/class/powercap is empty here. Earth's discipline is to take the concrete fact at the door rather than argue with it, so I asked what in the tree actually READS that fact. Nothing did.
think The arc is real and unmeasured. Measured 20260908.234221 by git grep over the flat pages of external-research, active-designing and foundations: 18 living pages name a joule, a watt or a kWh, 63 times between them, and the count of those figures read from a counter is zero.
think A complete instrument for exactly this question stood unlanded in .lap/ -- scan, control, agreement fixture, witness, and a Rye perf probe, authored 20260908.131900 and named in no session log, no commit, and no ledger row. A lap that never closed. I re-proved every piece on metal before writing a word about it.
think The distinction the scan is built around is existence against readability. Since PLATYPUS (CVE-2020-8694) Linux ships intel-rapl energy_uj at mode 0400, so a host can carry a counter that refuses every unprivileged read; a probe that stats the path reports a joule the caller can never have, which is worse than reporting none. Every reading opens the counter and requires digits back.
think The second wall is that sysfs declares and only a syscall hands over. tools/rye/perf_self_count.rye opens a self-scoped hardware counter with no root and no perf binary and reads back 23,000,054 retired instructions over a bounded million-iteration loop -- 23 per iteration. Declared tier and opened counter agree, and a disagreement is gated as a fault rather than reported as a host fact.
obs This pier reads tier=counters: powercap 0, hwmon 0, power_supply 0, RAPL perf events 0, msr absent, cpu PMU present with cycles and instructions at perf_event_paranoid 2. A host is not a fault, so the live pass reports and passes free; what the control gates is the probe's own ability to say joules when joules are there, since a probe able only to say none proves nothing by saying it.
obs The honest reach of a counters-tier host is relative rather than absolute. Energy is work times energy-per-unit-work, and this host measures the first term only; the second moves with frequency, voltage, cache behavior and the neighbours on the socket. Two implementations of one operation compared on one host in one hour is exactly what a counters rung settles, and most of this tree's energy questions are that shape.
obs Against myself, twice. I launched the cold roster pass and then edited the tree under it, which fixes its verdict at tree_moved forty minutes before it would say so -- 43 guards green and 0 red at the point I stopped it. And the witness header I inherited counted five refusals over twenty control legs where six stand; corrected before landing.
obs Stopping my own pass went through tools/f/fleet_call.sh rather than a bare pkill: 15 candidates on this pier, 1 in this tree, 10 peers refused out loud by working directory, 3 self, 1 unreadable. The lock released on the EXIT trap and the hot pass walked in.

file tools/fixtures/e/energy_instrument_agree.sh the second wall -- a declared tier must be one a process actually reaches
file tools/fixtures/e/energy_instrument_control.sh twenty legs on planted sysfs pens, six refusals bitten, the joule rung proven reachable
file tools/e/energy_instrument_witness.rish the rung; its counted claims corrected from five refusals to six before landing
file tools/rye/perf_self_count.rye a self-scoped hardware counter in authored Rye, no root and no perf binary
file construction/standing-equipment.kyri the roster row, tier lap at a measured 1.0s
file external-research/20260908-234506_the-tier-a-joule-is-measured-at.md the paper, graded A/94 at Field

file construction/archive/20260908-234659_itinerary-landed-accounts.md the elder account, shelved unedited
scope one instrument landed and one paper; no ledger row booked, since a host that exposes no joule is a fact rather than a fault
status GREEN -- energy_instrument witness green on metal with its control at twenty legs, tame_style_check and width-check green, hot roster pass named in the card
recommend keep-going -- the counters rung is proven reachable and nothing in the tree uses it; a ratio harness around two implementations of one operation is the next buildable thing
