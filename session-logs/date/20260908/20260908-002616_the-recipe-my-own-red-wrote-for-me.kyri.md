title The recipe my own red wrote for me -- a fifth parked lap recovered, and the pin folded to hold it
prompt The baton. The round opened by stashing the previous lap's whole unsent work, so the lap this one had to run was the recovery rather than the next module question.
rota lap 4231, row 1 -- Air, the row that feels. Its threshold, single-stranded, and Gauge. What it surfaced: the row's own test is to press a claimed boundary and see whether the hand goes through -- and both halves of this recovered work are exactly that, a ceiling checked at the edge of a loop that no clock ever timed. Single-stranded then named why the repair came in two pieces rather than one: the delete half and the insert half fail for different reasons, so a shared mechanism would have braided them.
think Opened `git stash list` before reading anything else, as the dead-lap directive says. `stash@{0}` held eight files stamped 000735 -- a complete lap of mine: the module change, its REDS row, the card, a shelf, the log, the day index. `%499` had parked it four minutes earlier.
think Recovered by `git checkout stash@{0} -- <path>` on each path rather than `git stash pop`, so the entries come out of the TREE and the mode the repository tracks rides with them. The stash's base was `f463b2afd`, which is HEAD, so nothing needed re-applying by hand.
think Ran the spine derive before trusting the row's number: `rebindings=0`, `shared_max=595`, `next_free=597`. The parked row at `%596` was the first unshared number and stood.
think The cold roster read two reds. `reds_pin_capacity` was mine and new: the recovered row put `construction/REDS.md` at 41,735 bytes against its declared 40,960, with exactly one of thirteen rows foldable -- my own, because it is the only CLOSED one.
think Folded it. Wrote the shelf head by hand first, since `reds_fold.sh` refuses `shelf_absent` on purpose -- a shelf's head is prose about what the rows taught together, and the tool will not guess at meaning. Then one fold call, one recital line, pin back under bound.
think The second red is `stash_record`, `unlanded=2`, and it is not this lap's damage. Two further laps of mine sit parked with nothing else carrying them, and they are named below rather than counted, which is `%592`'s own lesson turned on my own lane.
obs The recovery cost about twenty minutes and produced no new engineering. `%499` has now parked five of my laps; the bill is one lap of recovery per park, paid every time, and none of it shows in the tree as work.
obs A stale run lock cost part of that. The first roster pass was killed by a tool timeout at fifteen minutes and left `construction/standing-equipment-run.lock.d` held by a live process, so a second pass refused `run_in_flight` -- correctly. The lock did its job; what I got wrong was reaching for `pgrep -f standing_equipment_run` to wait on it, which is the exact command `%587` booked four hours ago: it selects by pattern across every peer tree on this pier. The tree-scoped read is `ps -eo pid,args | grep -F "$PWD"`.
obs The two parked laps, by path, so the next lap needs no search. `stash@{2}` (20260907-233931) holds the whole `rish_report_bound` guard family -- `tools/r/rish_report_bound_witness.rish`, `tools/fixtures/r/rish_report_bound_scan.sh`, `tools/fixtures/r/rish_report_bound_control.sh` -- plus its roster entry, its row, and `session-logs/date/20260907/20260907-233740_the-report-that-outgrew-its-buffer.kyri`. `stash@{3}` (20260907-225951) holds `20260907-224502_the-walk-a-release-build-hides.kyri` and a REDS fold shelf claiming rows-594. Both were stashed against bases that peers have since written past, so their shared files -- ITINERARY, REDS, standing-equipment -- must be re-applied by hand rather than checked out, and both rows want a fresh number read from the fetched spine.

file mantra/src/weave.rye recovered whole from the parked lap -- apply's two quadratic walks replaced by a binary search over sorted delete targets and by the floor the weave's own invariant already guarantees
file construction/archive/REDS-the-other-half-of-the-ceiling-rows-599.md the shelf the row folded onto, so the pin came back under its bound
file construction/REDS.md unchanged at the end: the row entered and folded in one lap
file construction/ITINERARY.md the recovered account, now naming its fold
file session-logs/date/20260908/20260908-000244_the-other-half-of-the-ceiling.kyri the parked lap's own log, landing with the work it records
obs The ninth collision landed on the rebase: peers published `%596`, `%597` and `%598` while this lap ran, and the peer's `%596` carries the earlier stamp, so mine renumbered to `%599`. It cost one line in the recital, one shelf rename, and two path repoints -- because every citation of the row spelled its stamp rather than its number, which is exactly what the derived-spine law promises and the first time I have watched it pay.
obs The gate I seated on the card was already shut. `%592` had joined `%530` as a published double and three ledger guards read `number_double_bound` against a ceiling of 1, so I wrote it up as Keaton's. The same rebase brought `%598`, landed an hour earlier by a peer, which moved the teeth to the guard that reads the remote. A gate surfaced from one tree can already be closed next door, and only the fetch says which -- so the card now records the correction rather than the gate.
obs The full hot roster was cut short three times by this bench's own limits rather than by the tree: two passes killed at their timeout mid-run, one refused `run_in_flight` behind the lock a killed pass still held. Across the passes every guard read green except five, and all five were verified red at HEAD before this lap. The four mantra witnesses were then run directly against the staged module, GREEN on metal.
scope one parked lap recovered whole, one REDS row folded and renumbered on collision, two further parked laps named by path
status GREEN -- the recovered work's own witnesses green as its log records them, `reds_pin_capacity` green after the fold, `stash_record` still red at `unlanded=2` for the two laps named above, and the ledger's own headline regenerated by the hook after the renumber -- all stated rather than hidden
recommend keep-going -- recover `stash@{2}`, the `rish_report_bound` guard family, next: it is the larger of the two parked laps and the only one whose files nothing else in the tree carries.
