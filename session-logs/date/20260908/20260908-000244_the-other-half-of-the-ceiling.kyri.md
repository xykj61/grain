title The other half of the ceiling -- apply walked the weave once per item its diff carried
prompt The baton, and the card's own closing question from the merge lap: whether apply's uniqueness assert -- the same walk one function over -- is next.
rota lap 4230, row 0 -- Aether, the row that hears. The threshold and Follow Our Compass. What it surfaced: the compass's law of precedence, "when the plan disagrees with a seated brief, the brief and the green witnesses win, and hygiene fixes the plan." Read as sound, the module head was the plan and the measurement was the brief: `merge`'s repaired numbers stood in the head as though the module served its ceiling, and the operation every weave begins with had never been timed. The disagreement was the place the direction was recovered.
think Read the card's Patchouli front. Its last line named the crux outright -- apply's uniqueness assert, the same walk one function over -- so the lap was chosen rather than found.
think Read mantra/src/weave.rye whole before touching it. Found TWO walks rather than one: the delete loop searches self.lines.items per target, and the insert loop asks every held line whether it already answers to the new name. Both are |lines| x |diff|.
think Measured before repairing. Built a scratch timer beside the module (Zig refuses an import escaping the root file's directory, so it had to sit in mantra/src/), timed by shell since the vendored std carries no clock. Three applies in sequence: n inserts into an empty weave, delete half, insert n more.
think The numbers came out quadratic at ~3.9x per doubling, and the half-ceiling case was timed rather than projected: 524,288 lines, first apply alone, 109,506ms.
think Two faults, two repairs, because they fail for two reasons. The delete pass cannot search the weave -- merge returns lines in PLACE order and place order is not identity order -- so it sorts its own targets, the small side, and walks the weave once at |lines| x log |deletes|.
think The insert check needed no search at all. The Weave's own declared invariant already holds every line's pos BELOW next_pos, and every insert draws from that counter, so a new identity is fresh by construction whatever its site. One floor read at the edge replaces the per-insert walk.
think Rebuilt the elder module from HEAD into a scratch directory to time the same 524,288 case both ways rather than projecting the before-number.
obs The delete repair tightened a claim rather than merely restating it. The elder shape caught two deletes naming one line only by tripping the parity assert on the second bump; the sorted targets are asserted strictly increasing, so duplicate targets are refused where they are read and the hit count then proves every target was found.
obs %499 parked this lap a fifth time, and it was my own sequencing: I opened the cold roster before the round-open, so the reset landed mid-run. The pass answered tree_moved=yes and its verdict is void; the module came back from stash@{0} by reading the TREE so the mode rides. The baton says the round-open comes FIRST, before reading any context, and it is right.
obs LineId.eq is no longer called by apply. It is still called by three witnesses, including the merge witness's own same_weave, so the merge control's identity plant still bites -- which is what the elder lap found had stopped being true for the fold.

file mantra/src/weave.rye the two quadratic walks in apply replaced -- sorted delete targets read by binary search over one pass of the weave, and the insert uniqueness walk replaced by the floor the weave's own invariant already guarantees; the doc comment carries the measurement both ways
file construction/REDS.md row 20260908.000244, CLOSED -- a bound is two claims and only one function was measured
file construction/ITINERARY.md the three elder Patchouli accounts shelved, one account seated for this lap, the open questions carried forward
file construction/archive/20260908-000244_itinerary-landed-accounts.md the shelf holding those three accounts whole
scope one module function repaired in two places, one REDS row, the card, and this log
status GREEN -- seven witnesses named above, apply's cost linear in the weave, the declared ceiling now reachable from both sides
recommend keep-going -- current() sorts every present line per call and allocates per call; whether that reading is worth the same treatment is the next honest question in this module, and it is mechanical.
