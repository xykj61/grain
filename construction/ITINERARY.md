# ITINERARY -- living operator card

**Language:** EN
**Status:** Living pin -- operator carry card
**Bound:** under `living_pin_max_bytes[construction/ITINERARY.md]` (40960, raised `20260906.001901` on Keaton's word -- 16 standing directives x 512, plus **8 ships x 2,048** for the live front, plus 16,384 for the durable spine. Only the live front moved: 5,161 -> 12,814 as the fleet went three -> eight, and per ship it is steady at ~1,602. Six checkpoints record a sweep forced by the elder ceiling. The general bound stays 24,576.)
**Voice:** Kyri

## INNER LOOP -- live directives the running loop applies each lap (seated `20260816.214652`, condensed `20260824.060012`)

*The outer shell loop reads this card first every lap, so a directive here takes effect on the NEXT lap without a restart. The agent MAY edit this block -- it is the inner loop the outer loop points at.*

**Directives only.** A landed round belongs in *Prior laps* below, one line pointing at its session log. The settled decisions this block released are held word for word at [`archive/20260824-130807_itinerary-settled-decisions.md`](archive/20260824-130807_itinerary-settled-decisions.md), which is the record; the two walk-back nibs those rows named were rewritten by the `20260826` deep debride and are kept as testimony in [`CHECKPOINTS.md`](CHECKPOINTS.md) rather than advertised here (REDS %280).

### Standing, every lap

- **ASCII-first.** Write every new document, comment, and commit message in plain ASCII -- `--`, `-`, `'`, `"`, `->`, `<=`, `gamma_2` rather than em-dashes, middots, curly quotes, arrows, or non-ASCII math. The one exception is a named set of work rounds (a Unicode module's own fixtures). This card was corrupted to mojibake once (REDS %83). Rule: `.claude/rules/ascii-first.md`.
- **Stamp and name, never an ascending mark.** Mark a lap by its one-clock stamp and a plain name -- `the standing movement (20260821-142939)` -- rather than `Fold AI`, `f0-f63`, or `X0/X1` for planned work. Count a total with `git log --grep ... | wc -l`. Waymarks stay (names, not counts); `rung` stays where a real ladder exists in code. A room that outgrows a reader folds to `<room>/date/YYYYMMDD/` keeping the WHOLE stamp in the filename, and a stale reference is resolved rather than rewritten -- `tools/d/dated_path_resolve.rish`. No fold ships without `tools/d/dated_path_witness.rish` GREEN, and a REDS fold runs through `tools/fixtures/r/reds_fold.sh`. **Waymark rungs are the retired form too** (%329): mark a rung by waymark, module or plain name, and stamp -- `FORA<N>`-shaped counters red `tools/w/waymark_rung_drift_witness.rish`, whose ceiling only falls. New `equinox_eNNN` guards take stamp-and-name (%330 books the family rename). Rule: `.claude/rules/stamp-and-name.md`.
- **The amend behind the empty-index check and its own target** (%255; %331): between commit and amend, `test -z "$(git diff --cached --stat)"` AND HEAD still equal to the hash read at the commit -- an amend resolves HEAD when it RUNS, and a peer landing between the calls puts your line into their commit.
- **Fetch-before-book** (`20260827`, %230/%252 closed): read a REDS row number only after `git fetch xy`; a collision renumbers to the fetched head.
- **Spelling: American.** `color` never `colour`; normalize on touch.
- **Style sweep before every send** -- Radiant pass over the round's prose (Twilight for a night piece), register only never a claim. Seed section 6.
- **Rota of the canon.** Each lap, deep-read ONE ROW of the 5 x 3 council grid in `recursion-prompts/seed/autonomous-loop.seed.md` section 1 -- lap N reads row N mod 5, three documents, so the canon returns roughly daily.
- **Roster cold, then hot -- and hold still while it runs.** Open the lap with `sh tools/fixtures/s/standing_equipment_run.sh`, let it finish; run again after `git add` as `... --hot` so the green measures the tree the commit ships (%174). A cold open over a dirty index refuses under `run_verdict=lap_unclosed`; `--hot` claims a round's own staged paths, and the flags compose (%223). The runner digests the tree at open and close, refusing `tree_moved` when they differ; editing it mid-run kills the shell (%221). **`--scoped`** (the fusion, granted `20260828`, landed `20260829`): a cold open or rebase re-verify with a FULL green receipt reproves only what moved since its head; skips named per guard, unmapped always runs, hot close and cadence stay full (receipts chain from full greens alone). **Counts come from the scan, never here.** Roster `construction/standing-equipment.kyri`. A `tier` names its clock: absent or `lap` every run, `cadence` the fifth round, when `--all` sings the choirs. A tier is a cadence, never an exemption; an unknown word refuses at zero.
- **A lap ends at the commit, never at `git add`.** `tools/hooks/pre-commit` regenerates `README.md`'s metrics block and `docs-geode/libraries/README.md` when a round adds a witness, and it fires at `git commit` and `--amend` **only** -- cherry-pick and rebase skip it, so `tools/hooks/post-commit` records the debt in `.git/` and rule one pays it next commit (%339). A round that stops after staging leaves both pages stale and any newly cited file untracked -- three times now (REDS %188, %220, %223). No guard can enforce the close, since one would have to run after the lap ends; what a guard can do is refuse to open the next lap over the wreckage, which is `staged_uncommitted` on line one and `run_verdict=lap_unclosed` when a full-roster pass meets a dirty index without `--hot`. **A dead lap leaves no dirty index** -- its leavings are stashed, and a stash is neither tree nor index; open with `git stash list` (%321).
- **Grade what you touch.** Every document, comment block, or design the lap opens gets one reading: `sh tools/fixtures/q/qa_report_card.sh <path> --setting door|field|meter --service N`. Four readings meaned to one grade -- Register, Reach, Truth (a gate: under 60 reads F), Service (judged against this card, in four questions worth 25 each: named, reached, current, and which side it carries -- public `grain-os/grain`, working `xy`, or both). **B or better stands.** Below B pushes **one** molt frame onto the round's stack, worked down before the sweep resumes; the stack is **bounded at depth 2**, and anything deeper becomes a line here. A dated writing leaves a mutant plus a bannered fossil and a Class M row; a living path molts in place under a checkpoint. **A low grade is not a red** -- Standfast owns what is wrong, this owns what could be better. **Match the setting to the class:** a pointer card reads `meter`, and a program is graded on its comments rather than its code (%276). Rule: `.claude/rules/quality-assurance.md`.
- **Reds first.** Close open agent-closable rows in `construction/REDS.md` before new work; one you cannot close surfaces like a gate.
- **Raw transcripts land in `session-output/`** (gitignored, `20260828`): each loop tees its outer transcript to one per-seat file, overwritten in place -- `mkdir -p session-output && <loop> 2>&1 | tee session-output/<seat>.txt` -- so agents read a peer's full output by path, not by paste.
- **Read scope -- open shelves and closed stacks** (`20260827.155213`): walk the open shelves; fetch a closed stack only by a named path -- every `date/`, `archive/`, and `yonder/` shelf, plus the rule's named roster. Never `ls` the root (`MAP.md` is the walk), never walk `tools/` whole (resolve by name), scope greps to the lane's rooms -- the whole-tree reference sweep before a move stays whole-tree by law. **A jailed inner lap (Mind's Codex) proves scoped witnesses only; the cold/hot roster rides with the pier and the unjailed benches.** Rule: `.claude/rules/read-scope.md`.
- **A fresh clone inits its submodules first, and a global `insteadOf` will stop it.** The vendored rungs need `vendor/{microkit,monocypher,pqclean,sel4}` checked out, and a RED from an empty `vendor/` is an environment fact rather than a tree red. A host that rewrites `https://github.com/` to ssh (this bench does) cannot clone the public third-party submodules at all, since the key has no rights there -- `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null git submodule update --init <path>` clones each one over plain https without touching the host's config. `--init --recursive` aborts on the first unreachable repository and leaves the rest untouched, so name the paths.

### Seated, and still live

*The panchanga, the fusion build, and the landed arcs rest on the [fourth shelf](archive/20260831-090000_itinerary-settled-decisions.md).*

- **The counsel campaign, Phase 1 standing** (`20260828`, Keaton's word): a lap may lift counsel insights into their right rooms as fresh-stamped mutants (B-door QA), banner the elders, Class M the rows -- `tools/fixtures/c/counsel_census_scan.sh` orders by citer count (941 pieces, 325 cited, 616 orphans at seating); the fourth shed circles on the word; **deep debride declined**.
- **An operational shell script molts to Rishi on substantial touch** (`20260828`): launchers, loops, tools a hand runs -- the `.sh -> .rish` family the MIND adaptation mapped, generalized; scan and control fixtures STAY sh by the witness convention.

- **The three Earth ships** (`20260904` names): unattended Claude Code; field GUI `~/grain` Cursor. **Incense** law/review/captain, `grain-incense`; **Pheromone** molecular, `grain-pheromone`; **Petrichor** docs-geode and prose-product, `grain-petrichor`. Machines are doors. Captain prompt (two doors, Mac or Dallas pier): `expanding-prompts/20260904-171306_incense-the-field-captain-two-doors.md`. Loop `fleet-loop.sh incense|pheromone|petrichor` from that tree (`tools/l/launch-earth-ships-chapter.rish`). One writer per tree (%291). Parked: `~/grain-mystery`, `~/grain-silence`. Elder charter `20260829.203718` stays testimony.
- **Fleet re-arm**: `sh tools/f/fleet_rearm.sh`.
- **SEATED -- Pond completes the enclosure** (`20260826`): the quest retiring ai-jail; docs accrete-only until the replacement is audited; switchover and jail debride gated (%5). Plan: `expanding-prompts/20260826-033051_pond-completes-the-enclosure.md`.
- **STANDFAST -- the Dexter orbit** (`20260826`): 15 rounds; door `dexter/README.md`.
- **Seated `20260826`, each behind its own door:** the **cubist sweep** (`cubist-bhakti-astrology/README.md`); the **Linengrow Design Theme** (gate %6); the **WADE journey** double-seat (plan in `expanding-prompts/`).
- **Seated names and breaches** rest on the [third shelf](archive/20260831-023122_itinerary-settled-decisions.md), each walk-back in [`CHECKPOINTS.md`](CHECKPOINTS.md). Live clause: the debride grant (`20260823.045448`) covers renames, message rewrites, force push, reclone; a deep debride takes Keaton's word naming its target.
- **The crypto spine** (`20260815`) -- four decisions whole on the [first shelf](archive/20260824-130807_itinerary-settled-decisions.md). Live clause: the identity key is the gate, the library is agent-doable.
- **Caravan -- semi-standfast, raised priority.** A touched module gets its opening comment as **Door** prose and its bound comments as **Meter**, per *Grade what you touch*. %163 one layer down.

### Now -- the live front

**Git nib:** `719eaa1450` -- HEAD's parent, resolvable everywhere (%401).

**BAKERY -- THE ONE READING THE GATE QUESTION TURNS ON NOW READS ZERO, AND READING IT WRONG WAS A ONE-LINE PREDICATE.**
Elder [shelved](archive/20260907-121623_itinerary-landed-accounts.md). Row `20260907.121623` CLOSED
and [folded](archive/REDS-a-label-is-not-its-target-rows-571.md); the number waits on `xy`, the
stamp is the key. **`stash@{0}` is landed** -- the duplicate lap's record and the half of its work
that survived the `declared` pass: five readings splitting the lost set into **promise against
mention** and **living against testimony**, printed beside the gate. Field: `9 / 76 / 3 / 82`.

**YOUR GATE QUESTION HAS A NUMBER: `lost_promised_living=0`.** All nine promises stand in dated
testimony, which accrete-never-break forbids repairing -- so moving the gate from `refs_lost` to
that cell gates the class that matters at a cost of nothing today. **I did not move it**; a gate a
lap moves for itself is a ceiling raised by a side door.

**AND THE FIRST READING SAID ONE, WHICH IS THE RED.** A day shelf names its log **twice** -- the
basename in backticks as the link **label**, `<day>/<basename>` as the **target** -- and the
basename-shaped test charged the target's kept promise to the label. One reference tree-wide, small
enough to open, which is why it was caught rather than published. Loose and exact answer two real
questions, and the shelf holds which; the pen now plants a label-and-target row so the loosening is
bitten. Witness GREEN, scan 110s.

**FOUR REDS ARRIVED WITH THE REBASE, ALL REPAIRED HERE, THREE OF THEM A PEER'S.** The card linked
`rows-565` where that shelf is `rows-561`, so `readme_reach` reds on the shared card for every ship.
Today's shelf carried one stamp twice, the `%381` shape a rebase leaves -- lifted, then sorted by
`index_shelf_repair.sh`. A peer's shelf landed with no recital line, `unrecorded_shelves` 63 over
62. And `tools/g/glow_desk_reach_witness.rish` wrote then removed a constant `/tmp` pen, `%549`
exactly: one ship's sweep deletes another's runner mid-read; a `$(pwd | cksum)` suffix returns
`constant_pen_files` to 53. **`fleet_watch` red hot and GREEN alone** -- a fourth guard in the
concurrent-pen flake family. **The pattern: a guard reds in MY tree for work landed in a PEER'S.**
Worth your word: should a send run the roster against `xy/main` before it rebases, so a peer's red
is named where it was made?

**Still yours, three.** The gate move above; a **verdict cache** for the census -- may a
**derived** row be gated? And the several-line interleave, wanting an anchor per insert.
**A record can be unlandable as written, and `stash_record` cannot see that.** The parked log
described a pass superseded 25 minutes later. It landed with two appended `obs` lines naming what
survived -- lawful, since an unlanded log is still being written -- and one `file` line rewritten
to **declare** the shelf that never landed: this family's own new mechanism used on itself.

**PATCHOULI -- A CENSUS WHOSE SUBJECT WAS "TODAY" REFUSED EVERY NIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.**
Row `20260907.114500` **CLOSED**, [folded](archive/REDS-the-day-that-had-not-started-rows-567.md),
cited by stamp until the spine binds it; the elder account
[folded](archive/20260907-120258_itinerary-landed-accounts.md).
`tools/fixtures/r/rota_declared_scan.sh` took its day from the clock and read it with `git ls-files`,
which reads the **index** -- so between 00:00 and the day's first COMMITTED log the shelf read empty
and the scan exited 2. Right about the count (`%170`), wrong about the **subject**: the day had not
gone missing, it had not started. A red guard withholds the roster
receipt, so `--scoped` refuses and **eight ships pay a full cold pass** -- nightly, healed by the
first commit, which reads as somebody's fault and then vanishes. The open day now falls back to the newest shelf that HOLDS tracked logs,
walking shelf **names** on disk so no date math enters, bounded at seven, printing `day_source=`. **A day a caller NAMES is not rescued** -- `ROTA_DAY` asked about
that day and is owed the refusal. Control **11 to 18**: both halves of midnight, the named-day
refusal, and the bound, proven in a pen. GREEN on metal. **An empty subject and an absent subject are two readings**, and `%170` left that
half open: the right answer to an empty shelf is sometimes a different shelf.

**Also:** `index_row_bound` red on the cold open, `%440` again -- one misordered shelf row, closed
by `tools/fixtures/i/index_shelf_repair.sh`.

**Still yours:** the several-line interleave, wanting an anchor per insert; **which of `%530`'s two
published rows renumbers** -- both stand, no byte need move, and the guard now holds the line rather
than asking; and **whether a lap's own transcript can be gated at all** (`20260907.084022`).

**DIFFUSER -- THE SHAPE THAT WINS EVERY MEASUREMENT EXISTS ONLY AT FACTORIAL SIZES, AND BOTH DOORS PAST THAT WALL ARE OPEN.**
Elder [folded](archive/20260907-111058_itinerary-landed-accounts.md). My paper's closing question,
measured: the star walks 7 on degree 5 at 720 points with **no table**, and has `n!` vertices, so a
tree of 840 members cannot have one. Seventeen **(n,k)-star** and **arrangement**
graphs built, walked, every vertex routed: **eight sizes** stand in the
720-to-5,040 window the star family leaves empty, and **S(7,4) walks 7 on degree 6 at 840 points**
where the best torus walks **14** and every degree-6 abelian shape walks **9 or more**. **The finding is the rule, and its first answer was short.** The star's rule read literally
is exact at k = n-1 and gives back 2 or 3 hops at **all eleven** sizes below it; a one-step fix
reaches the diameter, residue at two; a rule choosing by where a symbol's CHAIN ends --
in junk, a free eviction, or at symbol 1, a waste -- routes **every vertex of every size** by
a shortest path, scanning 0.54 candidates mean and 4 max, inside the elder's own price. GREEN as
**`topology_relaxed`**, `tier lap`: scan 10s, control **44 of 44**; the paper
`external-research/20260907-111058_the-size-you-actually-have.md` reads **A (96)** at Field.
**Yours, one, the falsifier a deployment meets first:** every reading assumes the shape **full**.
800 members on 840 vertices leaves 40 holes; if routing into one needs a table of live members,
free routing fails a real membership. Next round. **The cold open's one red was the
recorded `live_group_plant` flake, sixth firing**; I wrote that a detached launch fires it every
time, and **the hot pass refuted that inside the lap** -- same launch shape, green. **Still
yours**, on the shelf.

**PETRICHOR -- THE ROTA'S OWN CANON DID NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION IT TEACHES EVERY SHIP TO ANSWER.**
Elder [shelved](archive/20260907-114608_itinerary-landed-accounts.md). Every ship deep-reads three
of these pages a lap. Read all twenty through `two_rooms_doorway_scan_one.sh` at the seated
`20260705-203144`: **fourteen name no room**, three with **no `**Status:**` line at all** --
`standfast`, `the-three-depths-of-removal`, and `the-clock-and-the-mark`, **the Earth-Cardinal seat
itself**. Eleven name a lifecycle word and stop, which `TWO_ROOMS.md`'s own three-question table
says answers a different question. **The page that found it was the earth threshold**, whose body
lists *a page whose status names no room* among the wrong readings a lap should catch -- while its
own named none. Repaired by **reading each page and judging its register**: eight **mixed**, six
**checkable**; every edit accretes, nothing removed. **foundations/ post-seating fails 49 -> 35**,
exactly the fourteen. **It moves no guard and reds nothing** -- `foundations/` sits outside the
doorway roster -- so this is Pheromone's row `20260907.100235` worked on its narrowest subject,
**claimed** rather than widened. Their gate stands: subject and ceiling move together or not at all.
**YOURS, still:** may a lap resolve a peer's pid at all?

**PHEROMONE -- A METER THAT READ ONE OF TWO INSTRUMENTS.**
Row `20260907.122532` **BOOKED**;
[folded](archive/REDS-the-meter-that-read-one-of-two-instruments-rows-566.md). Last lap's named
seam, taken: `glow_desk_reach_scan.sh` read `covered` from the elder hand-written witness alone, so
it printed **83 bare-runnable desks "run by nothing"** while the rostered runner ran all 83.
`covered` is a **union** now -- witness **218**, runner **301**, union **301** -- the runner
**asked** with `--list` rather than re-derived, since a second derivation here would be a **fifth**
statement of the run-contract rather than a reading of the fourth. **`uncovered_bare` fell 83 -> 0 and changed character with its number:** no
backlog now, it is the **gate on two derivations agreeing** -- this scan excludes by the markers'
INTERSECTION, the runner by their UNION, so a half-declared desk reds here and at `norun_disagree`
together. **A runner that cannot answer `--list` refuses the whole reading**: an empty selection and
a broken instrument look identical in the arithmetic and mean opposite things. **Control 60 -> 81**,
the bare gate's refusal proven live by **muting the runner**. **YOURS, one:** the three `glow/gen/s/` data fixtures still
carry no marker in name or head, so nothing tells them from a desk that ought to run (`%532`, OPEN).

**PHEROMONE, prior round -- the derived runner** (`20260907.110022`, BOOKED): 301 desks derived and
run where the enumeration named 218. [Folded](archive/20260907-122532_itinerary-landed-accounts.md).

**INCENSE -- A PEN ISOLATED BY EVERYTHING BUT ITS NAME.** `20260907.120510` CLOSED,
[folded](archive/REDS-a-pen-isolated-by-everything-but-its-name-rows-571.md).
`fleet_watch_control.sh` named its pen seats `penone`..`pengone` -- **constants every copy of it
here writes into one process table**, which `fleet_watch.sh` reads by command-line **ending**.
**Third firing**, closed by making it fire. **17 cases.** **A pen is isolated by what it WRITES,
never by what it READS. THE SAME SHAPE CAME ON THE REBASE, NOT MINE:** `shared_pen` reads **54 of
53** -- `glow_desk_reach_witness.rish` WRITES `/tmp/glow_desk_reach_mute.sh`, so **every cold open
here reds** until its hand returns. **The rota ask came off this card answered:** its five
thresholds failed the doorway too -- **14 of 20**, not `%558`'s 9 of 15 -- and a peer landed all
twenty while this send was in flight.

**YOURS, AND IT COSTS THE FLEET A LAP A DAY: THE ROUND-OPEN PARKS AN ORDINARY LOST RACE.** `%499`
OPEN. `fleet_round_open.sh` classifies by two `is-ancestor` tests and **two states fail both** -- a
real upstream rewrite, where parking is right, and the fleet's own ordinary outcome, where a peer
pushed on the base you built on and `git rebase` re-derives you whole. Its own header prescribes
re-derivation for the push refusal and parking for that same state one step earlier. Measured on
`xy`: **11 `pier/diverged-*` branches, 33 distinct subjects since `20260828`; 23 later reached main
by a hand, TEN never did** -- one of them the tablecloth find this card carried below as open, and
two more parked within twenty minutes of the reading. **The discriminator is local:** the merge-base
equals the parent of the oldest commit in `xy/main..HEAD` exactly when the local line's base still
stands upstream. **Not taken** -- six ships run that file. **A park keeps every byte and still costs
the lap.** *My third row of this lap was **withdrawn rather than renumbered**: it booked
`sow_allow_reach`, and a peer had booked exactly that at `20260906.133724`, which stands published
as `%493` above -- the fourth time in one day that a finding and its peer met in the same hour.*

**Yours, one question; law, so INCENSE may own it.** The five negatives `mycelium` keeps are its
**subject**: two Meter claims, a *no real key, no funds, no network, no custody* disclaimer, and the
benediction [`radiant-wishes-ending`](../.claude/rules/radiant-wishes-ending.md) asks for. **A Door
page obeying both floors at four: 16% of a 20% ceiling.**


**`%481` CLOSED, both accounts folded** ([shelf](archive/20260906-133957_itinerary-landed-accounts.md)) -- **a marker makes a pin longer, so the one meter aimed here read the damage as growth**, three firings, the last caught before its push.
**AND THE EQUALITY ARC HAD NO RUNNER FOR 7 OF 8** -- `%482` **BOOKED**
([shelf](archive/REDS-a-proof-nobody-runs-rows-482.md)). The four Mantra gates build GREEN,
**unheard rather than rotted**, now `tier cadence` 92s; Aurora's three and Caravan's one stay
unheard. **Yours:** `src/gate/README.md` graded Truth **100 on twelve resolving paths** over seven
unrun proofs.
**The identity gap** -- two branches inserting collide at one small integer and merge refuses them
`PositionTextDisagrees`, since `pos` counts inside one weave. Closing it wants a wider `Line`; the
guard said to lock that is `%500` above, and it now reds honestly.
**`%440` fired ELEVEN times across four laps** -- a peer's row low at the cold open, then every rebase auto-merging the shelf; one dedupe-and-sort each time, by hand. **Yours.**

**PHEROMONE `%460` OPEN** ([shelf](archive/20260906-051500_itinerary-landed-accounts.md)). **Yours:** may a cross-target witness read GREEN with a named gap when qemu is absent? `%446` reads the other way; `capability` is the mechanism.

**GRASS -- 58 GUARDS ON A CLOCK NOTHING TURNS.** `--tier cadence` has no caller, so **0 of 58**
hold a receipt. Sung: **5,106s, 5 RED**; `cadence_never_run_here` **58->2** and
`standing_equipment` now `roster_broken`.
[Account](archive/20260907-113635_itinerary-landed-accounts.md).

**THE SAME HOLE FOR LINKS.** `%524` OPEN: three commit-time link walls read ONE row
shape, so a cairn citing an archive shelf waits for a cold pass; four fired today.
`readme_reach_scan` reads **1,808 documents in 295ms**, cheap enough for that debt.
**Carried: 890** depth-lost links.

**COPAL -- A DOOR AND THE WALL ARE TWO NUMBERS, AND ONLY THE SMALLER IS A PROMISE.**
(`20260907.103031`) CLOSED, [folded](archive/REDS-a-door-and-the-wall-behind-it-rows-565.md);
elder [shelved](archive/20260907-104723_itinerary-landed-accounts.md). Amphora's season door declared
**16** files; 1,024 cargo bytes over an 85-byte line carry **12** -- exit 0 at 12, `cargo too
large` at 13 to 16, **four slots unreachable at any name**. **No marker could spell it:** the
relation is a PRODUCT where `couples`/`covers` compare bound to bound, so it went to the compiler
**both ways** (`n*line <= roof`, `(n+1)*line > roof`), plants 11, 13, 16 each stopping the build.
**Guard failed safe:** a draft DERIVED it and read `partner_absent` -- it reads a spelled value. **Yours:** a `band` word on a roster row; `ios_app_shell`, LOCA.

**MANY HANDS** (`20260828`): custody MANUAL, one writer per checkout; every clone seats `ww`
(gate %1) and `.git/ssh_config_jail`.

**Sibling finds:** Mystery's module-label guard fails open on BSD grep; portable, it names elder labels in `fascia_metric_v0.rish`. **Tablecloth, one, cross-lane:** its name desk
reads one of `max_name`'s two call sites (`parse_manifest` reads it too, over the same fixed
`[max_name]u8`). *The four uncontrolled `*_example_missing` verdicts are no longer a find: the work
stands written at `cc1da84f7`, parked by a round-open and unlanded since `20260905` (`%499`).* **Dream's parked packages:**
`xy/pier/diverged-20260831-{064342,115245}`, neither landed, neither mine. **CION:** `drey`'s rung marks are the retired form (%329). **Fleet loop (%387):** should a
round's opening stash stop an in-flight pass in its own tree.

**Bounds raised `20260906`, both derived, both yours:** card and REDS pin to 40,960 (8 ships x 2,048 live front; 8 x 4,096 OPEN set + 8,192 header). **Each is sized per ship, so both re-open at twelve** -- and the pin's is also sized by how fast reds close (`%360`, 8,213 bytes, open since `20260830`).
**`%456` OPEN -- eight ships share ONE login, so one credential is a fleet-wide outage** (read from `agent-jail.sh` source, so `%458` leaves it standing; the pier half is unmeasured from inside the enclosure). Seven died 3 laps each in ten seconds on `OAuth session expired and could not be refreshed`. The refresh token had **27 days** left, so expiry is excluded -- the leading read is **rotation**: first refresher strands the rest and the pier's own copy. **Falsifier is cheap:** watch whether the pier's refresh value changes after a ship refreshes. Landed: `claude_refresh_dead()` names a dead credential instead of seeding it, proven 3 ways, and `sh tools/fixtures/f/fleet_login_scan.sh` answers it in one command. **Yours, gate 3:** one login per ship is the fix. **A resource shared by every ship has no blast radius smaller than the fleet.**
**`shell_dialect` re-diagnosed:** the `sed -i` repair stands; it reds on ONE case of 47 -- *a guard
without its instrument names rg rather than a file*. `shell_portable_control.sh` takes `rg` off PATH
by dropping every entry holding an executable `rg`, and this NixOS pier keeps `rg` and `sh` in one
directory, so the scan under test cannot start. A pen of symlinks to every tool but `rg` is the fix.
**Hot pass `20260906.212721`: 155 guards, 152 green, 0 red, 3 gated, 1139s** -- `tree_moved=no`, `skipped_capability` **1 -> 0**.
**`%439`-`%441` FOLDED** to one [shelf](archive/REDS-what-no-meter-was-reading-rows-439-441.md): three claims where no instrument reads.
**`%360` advanced twice more** (`compass_rose`, `standing_equipment`): `unheard` **674** of ceiling
**1,093** -- 419 of slack; the elder *14 under* is superseded. **Yours.**
**Still open:** `glow/rune_shape.rye` width custody; `%281`/`%291`. **(%347):**
`pond/enclosure_policy.kyri` 8,120/8,192; yours.
**THE LIVE FRONT NOW FOLDS** (`20260905.130819`): landed accounts shelve like REDS rows, so the
card holds what is OPEN and what waits on your word.
**Gate 3 stands:** `.gnupg-rye/` holds
`private-keys-v1.d/`, and **per-tree GNUPGHOME is the only shape that works jailed** -- yours.
**52 external utilities across 2,969 tool scripts. `rg`: 992 sites, ONE probe. `mktemp`: 353
sites, none -- not POSIX since 2008.** The cure, `tools/fixtures/s/shell_portable.sh`, is sourced by
**38 files, 1.3%.** Three tiers -- **granted** (POSIX), **carried** (we ship it), **borrowed**
(probe, fall back, announce). **The reflex LANDED** (`%445`); the tiers stay yonder, yours.

**Worth your word, still unanswered, and asked from FOUR blocks of this card until merged here
`20260906.212057`:** nothing in the ledger shows a red is *being worked*, so two hands spend one
morning on the same line. **Should an OPEN row carry a claim -- a seat and a stamp, at
start rather than at landing?** **Seventeen firings.** Bakery's own chain ran `%485` -> `%501` ->
`%503` -> `%504` -> `%506` in one day, beaten four times while the work sat parked. Asking it in
four places made it read as four questions rather than one.
**`%513` answered the citation half** -- cite by stamp until the spine binds the number. The
claim half stands, and this lap paid it: `20260906.195208` renumbered THREE more times while
parked, and cost one line because every living citation already spelled the stamp.
**Yours, two (%417).** A **guided map** fits neither shape offered: `MAP.md` reads **C/74** at 67
links over 913 words -- 7 per 100 against Door's 1 -- where the root README carries 53 over 2,005
and reads B+. **Second instance `20260906`:** `docs/COMPASS.md` reads **C+/79** on reach alone, 4
links over **49 words** of mostly table -- under the index floor, yet declaring `Depth: guide`.
**Yours, one.** Door's ceiling is **9** against module heads running 12-17. Of 163 sampled
programs 115 read below B -- yet **51 sat under the register floor** with nothing measurable,
leaving **64** truly scored at 9-23. That second number owns the ceiling question, and Gauge's own
table seats **witness headers** at Meter where this card grades every program head at Door.
Gate %7: quality-assurance additive carried `20260904.103121`.

## Landed arcs

Twelve, whole on the [fourth shelf](archive/20260831-090000_itinerary-settled-decisions.md); each
account is in `session-logs/`.

## The Compass Chapter -- OPEN `20260809.021829`, now at JARL

Four equinoxes (SOON [x] - JARL - BUHR - TACT); four JARL seats GREEN; next-chapter breach OPEN
`20260810`. Table: [`20260829-141640` shelf](archive/20260829-141640_itinerary-settled-decisions.md).

---

## Waymarks

**No roster here** (`20260907`; it stood at 13 of 30). Seated set `construction/waymark-registry.bron`, sealed; face `.claude/rules/waymark-ladders.md`, agreed **both ways** by `waymark_registry_witness`. Live chapter: **SOON - JARL - BUHR - TACT**. Draw: `tools/w/waymark_derive.rish`. Claims `waymarks/`.

## Pier & hands

- **Host** -- this Mac (Incense, America/New_York) and Vultr Dallas (`45.32.204.176`, `Host pier`, `keeper`, AMD 4/8/180). Never EWR.
- **Pier path** -- Mac field `~/grain`; Host pier ships `grain-incense`, `grain-pheromone`, `grain-petrichor` (no `~/grain` on Dallas). NixOS rebuild from the checkout you pull, via `bash nixos/rebuild-outer.sh`.
- **Lane** -- every **send** pushes `xy` then `debrided`; ls-remote guard first; `debrided` may 403 from the cloud (home pier closes the gap). Map: [`../PUBKEYS.md`](../PUBKEYS.md) - [`../context/REMOTE_ROSTER.md`](../context/REMOTE_ROSTER.md).
- **Jail authors; host installs** -- agents write inside the enclosure; USB `adb` installs and key ops stay Keaton's hand.
- **Live state** -- Dallas jail is up; v1.20.2 defaults network off. agent-jail.sh now passes `--network` so APIs resolve.
- **Cursor launch** -- field: Cursor.app. Unattended Earth ships: `claude` signed in, then `fleet-loop.sh` from that tree (Linux: agent-jail wrap). Field jail: `cursor_jail_macos.rish`.
- **Outer terminal / phone** -- USB/`adb` and the phone look stay on the operator desk; read chapter state from the git nib and `prin scope`.

---

## Two grains

The private field is `~/grain`; the public template **grain-os/grain** is *projected* by
`tools/s/sow.rish` along `template-manifest.bron`, proven clean by `tools/s/sow_witness.rish` -- no
name or key crosses. The scrub reaches every name, handle, and contact form case-insensitively, and
a leaking file is withheld whole: privacy over completeness (%225). Raw PII waits for the **Vault**.
The publish push is Keaton's hand.

## Shred-prep

[`SHRED_PREP.md`](SHRED_PREP.md) -- Class H fossils - Class O rooms (propose-never-seat) - **Python->Rishi molt seated** (`20260809`, prep only) - shred stays **RED** until circled. **debride** is the stronger word (removes dead history, deep on Keaton's word).

---

## Custody gates -- an autonomous agent STOPS here and surfaces (never crosses)

For any self-paced or outer-jail loop: recur through all agent-doable work, yet **stop and surface -- never cross -- these custody, irreversible, and provisioning acts.** They are Keaton's hand by design:

1. **The seed** -- each refresh takes its own word (AHOY3 final push DONE `20260812`; one force-push commit, anonymous, unsigned by design). Full row: [`archive/20260824-130807_itinerary-settled-decisions.md`](archive/20260824-130807_itinerary-settled-decisions.md).
2. **Provisioning or paying** for any cloud/VPS/Pond/subscription (Vultr IaC, WADE2/3) -- agents author IaC; Keaton provisions and pays. SEA cancelled `20260903`; Dallas is the standing pier.
3. **Moving funds, holding keys, or opening any custody/wallet/payment rail** -- Dimeroll records facts only; disbursement waits on licensed counsel. **The seam, named `20260905` (%427):** *generating* key material is this gate; *relocating a ship's existing keys so its own jail can reach them* is agent-doable, since it changes reachability and no trust relationship. A fresh key per ship needs a hand at GitHub before that ship can push at all, so it stays here.
4. **Generating Keaton's own Kumara instance** from his real seed/keeper -- his hand alone.
5. **Deep debride / history rewrite + force-push** of the living tree -- named target, Keaton's explicit word.
6. **Seating a new module in a collaborator's domain** (e.g. DJINN's surface lead) beyond authored implementation-floor code -- the invitation and lead are the collaborator's to accept.

7. **The drifted rule pairs** (REDS %194; measured `20260829`): of 39 drifted, ONE was additive-one-side (gauge-style -- synced under the word's middle door) and **38 are two-way**, so each stays its own reading here; a bulk merge silently deletes a live safety rule. Classifier: `sh tools/fixtures/r/rule_twin_additive_scan.sh`.

Everything else -- design, code, witnesses, docs, weaves, seed *projection* (not push), reds -- is agent-doable and does not wait.

**Seed cadence -- SETTLED `20260826`: cut.** Gate %1 governs alone.
**One wart:** `sow_project.sh`'s sed-copy drops the exec bit on the seed's `tools/hooks/commit-msg`,
so the armed-wall promise rides on the publisher.

## Open doors (awaiting Keaton's word)

| Door | Kind |
|------|------|
| **`%530` bound twice**, both published ([law](../.claude/rules/derived-spine.md)) | live |
| **Gate `%7`** -- retire `.cursor` ([prep](SHRED_PREP.md)) | live |
| **Next JARL step** -- escape, membership-commitment shrink, or the scarcity call | live |
| **Breach OPEN `20260810`** -- Pond = application module (Pool retired) - **skies lap 1** - **topology inclusive** (galaxy is star is planet, 720/universe, sponsor by mod, **outfit** roles; 6 witnesses GREEN) - **Kyri** the notation (was Bron) - **Skate** = the social network | breach - live |
| **MOX constellation on SUI** -- `xykj61` as the maintainer's planet; which instantiation answers for which point, and how a planet resolves to a Mycelium store. Design agent-doable; anything touching a real chain is a gate | booked `20260823.184309` |
| **Three corridor bundles placed, held at the gate** -- fiber (KC), headwaters (Gallatin), works (Brazos); Laps 6-9 await the word. Prompts: `expanding-prompts/20260825-1719{12,18,24}_*.md` | check-in `20260825.171907` |
| **Kumara seed-key derivation** -- one high-entropy seed in Vault from which the Comlink X25519/Ed25519 and post-quantum SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256s keys derive by domain-separated SHAKE-256, the path carrying a scheme tag and a version. An agent writes and witnesses the derivation against test vectors and fake constel identities and stops there | booked - custody-gated |
| **Keaton's own Kumara instance** -- generate from his real seed + keeper, by his hand alone | JARL - when ready |
| **Held doors** -- TAME core/shelf - Identity Remake/Kumara - Geode - Grainphone - Realidream - Pond seven - data-dignity - succession - Mand ring-3 - O3 gen-home | awaiting Keaton |

*Four granted rows moved to the [`20260829-141640` shelf](archive/20260829-141640_itinerary-settled-decisions.md); four elder resolved rows on the `20260824` one.*

## Card habits

- **kg** -- keep going, next mechanical lap. **check-in** -- pause for Keaton's word / design. **send** -- commit - push both remotes - merge. **remember** -- reprint this card. **align** -- walk the compass, reconcile plan with green witnesses. **molt** -- prep a fossil for shed. **debride** -- remove dead history (Keaton's word). **shred** stays RED until circled. remember != send != kg != align.
- **Vocabulary** -- the tree seats **shape**, not Hoon's *mold*. Prefer **git nib**. One clock: `TZ=America/New_York`.

---

*Carry lightly. Prefer git nib. `prin scope`. May the chapter stay clean and the fascia hold.*

## Next -- the ranked remainder

**BOOKED `20260907.074815` -- two grants.** *petrichor* molts, relinks and shed-preps in its lane once synergy with Mantra, the weave and Tablecloth is proven; *diffuser with bakery* researches table stores for the most TAME-aligned scheme, then silos and plans. [Brief](../active-development/20260907-074815_two-grants-a-molt-lane-and-a-table-store.md).

**BOOKED `20260907.074407` -- petrichor: the operator manual into docs-geode; `manual/` and `docs-geode/` one room or two. [Brief](../active-development/20260907-074407_the-operator-manual-and-two-doc-rooms.md).**

**BOOKED `20260906.173141` -- 26 of 2,030 tools misfiled by letter room**, past the resolver.


Ranked Lindy-first and crux-first, with costs, gates, and falsifiers, in
[`../expanding-prompts/20260823-124407_the-ranked-remainder.md`](../expanding-prompts/20260823-124407_the-ranked-remainder.md);
the measurement class behind it is
[`../active-designing/20260824-080208_the-roster-that-decides-what-gets-measured.md`](../active-designing/20260824-080208_the-roster-that-decides-what-gets-measured.md).

**Named and waiting on their own lap:** the **fascia weave** (39 browsed `active-designing/`
documents); ten pages wanting a
Status line; the **`constels/`** room and the **kres/kresfa chapter** (seated
`20260823.122619`). Two i10 ratchets, migrate-on-touch: 26 `parseInt(` sites, 321 over-70
functions. Third mitra shed prepped (`SHRED_PREP.md` Class H), cut RED until circled.

## Prior laps -- landed, with the detail in the log that recorded it

The logs keep the account; earlier rows are shelved in
[`archive/`](archive/) under `itinerary-settled-decisions` and `itinerary-landed-laps`.

| Landed | Round | Log |
|---|---|---|
| `20260907.120510` | A pen isolated by everything but its name | [log](../session-logs/date/20260907/20260907-120510_a-pen-isolated-by-everything-but-its-name.kyri) |

**One row, on purpose** -- a landed lap keeps one line until the next replaces it; the log carries the detail.
